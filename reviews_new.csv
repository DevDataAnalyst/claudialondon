1,"Landmark hotel for Starwood Preferred Guests. A must visit if you haven't been there before but the location is an issue. If you are looking for quiet and peaceful stay.. this may not be the right choice for you. You can still hear music blastic into the middle of the night. We got into the Marvelous Suite, but I found the layout extremely odd. When you first enter the suite, you'll be greeted with a basin on a bar top with a bath tub behind it. The bar top can also be used to work? At the same area, that's where the closet, toilet and bath room are situated before you pass a sliding door in to the bedroom. By the side of the room, you'll see a huge pillar which made the experience in staying in the suite a little claustrophobic for me. If it is the only Marvelous suite they have, I won't recommend it.",Marvelous ?Suite?

2,Stayed there 2 weeks ago in the penthouse ( Extreme WOW suite) and absolutely enjoyed myself. I had some friends over for a little party and they all loved it too. We ordered some food from in-room dining which was delicious. Also visited the Bar for a couple of drinks and even though we asked for cocktails that weren’t in the menu the bartenders were very kind to make them for us. The staff were all very polite and friendly from check-in to check-out which made the experience even better. ?? Job well done! Many thanks to all!

3,First mistake was reserving a hotel that has a bar and lounge. It was aweful walking into a hotel where people were smoking and hanging out in the entry. The bar music could be heard from the street- not a very relaxing atmosphere.We arrived around midnight and were placed in a room that had an overwhelmingly stinky odor. The quarters were so tight that the sink was in the middle of the room. The room was dirty- the pillows had hair (not ours) on it.The management moved us and gave us a free upgrade to a suite. Don’t be impressed- the suites are not that great- they are normal size with a normal bathroom. The hotel staff and management had no idea what service is. We asked for double coffee and cream for our nesspresso- it came the first day only. The halls were painted black- the carpet-black- it was so dark- you couldn’t help thinking they were dirty and dingy. The chamber maids were untrained- kept moving our things around in the bathroom- not thinking we purposely separated our things because we were two people.The bathroom was so dimly lit- you couldn’t put make up on- there were not outlets to blow dry hair in the bathroom. There were no mirrors in the room to put on make up or blow dry hair.- this experience was below satisfactory. We had just came from the Westin Dublin where the hotel and service was impeccable- so this was a big disappointment.To top it off- as we checked out- the hotel staff said there were no notes on our free upgrade and complimentary breakfast- so they wanted to charge us- seriously?! It took the staff a half an hour to check us out- our UBer to the airport had to cancel and the delay caused us to cancel our Heathrow personal shopping service appt.,Will Never Go Back,25.04.2018,1,mobile,N/A,3,18,4,4,2018,with family,3,4,4,4,4,4,01-05-2018,male,25-34,Travel,0,Yes,N/A

5,"The location of the hotel is perfect for anyone that wants to stay central London. located right in the heart of Picaddily/ Leicester square It's about a 10-minute walk to Oxford Street for anyone that wants to hit the shops and do some shopping. The Hotel Rooms are small for a W Hotel Chain. However, you've got good amenities around you with lots of restaurant options. The Hotel has a gym and a Spa located on the top floor with great views of the city from the gym. The hotel is easily accessible by London Underground Tube station with 2 tube stations within 4-8 minutes walk from the hotel. Except you are getting the suite there is not that much of a difference between the different category of rooms at the W.

6,"Where to start?! The location is really great, a walking distance from most of Central London most visited areas. The staff were amazing and very welcoming and I mean all of them. My first room was nice and neat but not practical from design point of view. There was an island in the middle of the room which has the sink!! so you wash up and brush your teeth in the middle of the room!! The toilet has very limited space and when you flush it splashes outside the toilet seat. That night I had to go back to the front desk and ask for a more convenient and practical room. So I had to upgrade to a suite and I was charged £80 per night :(. But I'd like to thank Mr. Ted on the front desk who was really nice, helpful and patient. Also I'd like to thank Mrs. Marina at the Whatever Whenever ""Concierge"" for her help. The suite was really clean and has a big window that added more to the space. The housekeeping staff were very helpful in every aspect. Apparently there's a famous bar in the first floor!! I could tell from the people lining up every night at the hotel entrance to get in.

7,"Stayed for two nights in one of the suites on the 7th floor. Have to say the room was fantastic! Huge bed, even bigger sofa and loved the quilted closet look and totally open space (warning if you like your privacy!). The toilet and shower are the only things behind (mirrored) doors in the room but this was perfect for me and hubby and the couple we had join us as we ordered room service and had drinks in what was a very sociable and roomy space.

10,"Stayed here with Wife for a long weekend, although I noticed at breakfast that guests ranged from solo travelers, couples as well as families so it is suitable for all in my view. The hotel has the usual W-Brand with modern design and music etc. We had a suite which was really spacious, clean and comfortable - I cant fault the room in any way, everything we needed was there including tea/coffee, mini bar, privacy, etc. Location is absolutely perfect, as you have Leicester Square and China Town right on your doorstep and therefore everything else is in walking distance or a short tube ride away. A nice thing about being here is that for theatre shows you dont have far to travel to get there and back. Breakfast is served in a restaurant attached to the hotel (Lobster & Burger Restaurant) and I have to say that the staff and service were really great - usual buffet style for cereal/continental breakfast plus made to order full english breakfast or just eggs or waffles etc - although you also have many breakfast options on your doorstep in the area. Staff at this W hotel were excellent with very efficient check-in/out and the concierge and security teams were very friendly and helpful. Tube stop in Leicester square is minutes away.

I was allocated the first night room 218 which was just above the hotel bar and way to noisy until late. Was moved on 2nd night to room 518 which was just perfect. Bath design ( at least in the suite allocated to us) was beautiful but be aware that there are no curtains... not sure how much neighbors can see... a few faults in the 1st suite reported via the hotel what's app ( faulty TV and kettle) as well as Ouse from the bar.

15,"This hotel is a beautiful W in the middle of Leicester Square. If you're in London for touring, it's close to just about everything you need and want. If you're here for business, I would suggest somewhere more low key and quiet. You're in between 2 major Underground stations, and steps from Chinatown. There's a ton of chain restaurants and tourist shops nearby, if that's what you want. However, you're also steps away from hundreds of great neighborhoods, boutiques, and Michelin starred restaurants. The hotel itself is very funky, like every other W. Some of the other reviews seem like the hotel is a shock to people. All W hotels are modern and loud...this is no different. The staff were all very nice and helpful. Expect a little wait time for the elevators/lifts, as there are 3, and the hotel can get quite busy. You will certainly pick up some of the lively noise from outside, but not enough to disturb you. I stayed in one of their Marvelous Suites, and the room was fantastic. Huge for any hotel, but especially a city like London. If you're spending a lot of time in your room then you're doing London wrong. However, the time spent at the hotel and in the room was great. I have no qualms with this place.

16,"Asian American Couple with 1 toddler in tow. SPG-P100 with ambassador booking. Flew in to Heathrow, and 1 hour Taxi ride through traffic to property. Arrived around 11am. Successful upgrade to Marvelous Suite with Upgrade Awards.  Staff - Mixed experience here, but overall happy. There was one dud staff member that checked us in. Our room apparently wasn't ready because the SPG-P member that was currently occupying the room had advised a late check out of 2pm. I told her that I have one pregnant wife and a toddler that just came off of an 11 hour flight. Maybe put us in a temporary room just so we could rest? This woman, who didn't even fit the part of the model W staff, attractive/clean, had no sympathy and told us we could pay to shower at the Spa. I never said I wanted to shower, do I smell? Anyway, we're not jerks so we went across the street to get lunch at Shake Shack. Only killed about 45 min. We went back, ended up hanging out on the sofa at the lounge right next to the front desk. We all dozed off for a bit. I woke up, and thought, I should contact the ambassador because the room really should have been ready. The property knew about our arrival time for weeks. Emailed the ambassador, and she replied immediately to see if she could get a temporary room. What do you know, I get a text a few minutes later, around 230pm saying that our room is ready. And THIS became the key to our happiness. From that day, we were able to iMessage who ever it was on the other side of that chat thread. From, our sink is broken, to we're leaving the room late - please service our room. They responded fast, and with courtesy. Never again did we have to call for anything, not to mention, those times we DID try to call, there was always a busy tone. The guys staffing the door were extremely courteous, more like St Regis than W.  Dining - Platinum breakfast at the Burger & Lobster chain restaurant downstairs. Good solid breakfast. A bit confusing to if the wait staff will bring you coffee, or if you're supposed to go get it yourself from the Continental Buffet. It was inconsistent everyday, but I had one the best cups of coffee in my life there. Anyway, food was decent, definitely one of the top SPG breakfasts. One morning I went down just to get a cup of coffee to go, but they could not find the disposable cups. I ended up just taking their dine-in cups to the room, no big deal. A tip, if you want to go directly to the restaurant for breakfast, take the middle elevator down to ""M"". That'll open up right into the Mezzanine level of the restaurant which is where breakfast is served.  Rooms - As with all W's, rooms are very modern, sharp, colorful, and not always the most functional. We expected this, and knew what we were getting into. As you've read from other reviews, the bathroom layout is strange and ideal. I'm really convinced the W is focused on those after party one night romance situations, direct from the downstairs club, and into the bedroom. Mirrors everywhere, hidden showers, and the most odd place for a trashcan out of site. Fine I get it, its neat for what it is. HOWEVER, because the sink is on an island, there appears to be some plumbing design issues. Sewage gas or odors of decay are present when you first start running water down that drain. I assume there is a P-trap or sewage ventilation issue with this design, and made brushing our teeth a very disgusting moment. At that first inhale when you brush your teeth, our lungs were filled with the most rude odor. We eventually learned to brush elsewhere. On one of those days, the drain plug wouldn't open anymore, and the building engineer had to completely deconstruct the cabinetry to get deep inside.  The shower and bathroom ""closets"" are behind very heavy and misaligned mirror doors. Cool idea, but not durable. The mirror entry door had shattered glass in the corner which I'm surprised they've never fixed. I will upload the picture here, but I'm not sure if it will be allowed to show. Location - Awesome location if you're a tourist. Not a good business trip location. Taxi's must drive down the short dead end street, and take turns making 3 point turns. At night, before the club shuts down, you have a huge line of taxi's down the street. Lots of night life, and turns dead from 2am-11am. Chinatown actually has pretty good Authentic Chinese food. It also has some bad Westernized Chinese food, beware. Hop On Hop Off bus is right across the street. Location is great if you intend on walking everywhere. No matter what direction you walk, you'll find something interesting. Piccadilly Station is about 3 short blocks away.  Conclusion - No regrets. Curious about the Le Meridien down the street, but reviews say it is in need of a major remodel. In the future, would consider living further out, and using that savings to pay for more Taxi rides. The W also has some deferred maintenance, and at this price, it should not be so obvious. And for that, one less star.",Great Tourist Location - Not so great for Tourist Rooms,04.05.2017,4,Desktop,"San Francisco, California",5,42,22,58,2016,with family,5,5,4,5,5,4,01-04-2017,male,35-49,Travel,1,Yes,Marvelous Suite
17,"In a suite here at the moment, after upgrading, see below.  If you ever wondered what a room would be like if it were designed by someone who had never stayed in a hotel, and likely cracked out, well here's your answer. Booked a standard room, it's more of a standard bathroom with an attached bedroom. Who the hell puts the bathroom in the middle of the room, yes that's where the sink and counter are, literally the middle of the room. Toilet and shower, they're in the closet. Seriously they are each in their own closet. The layout was so bad I chose to upgrade to the only offering with a separate bathroom...really should a separate bathroom be a 100pound upgrade? Toilet and shower are still in closets (if you're claustrophobic don't do it), but the closets are in their own room. The suite has an nice additional ""upgrade"" there's not a single electrical outlet in the bathroom (yes we called downstairs to confirm). Want to dry your hair, or curl it...go to the ""bedroom"" and do it without a mirror. Do the rooms look cool, sure. Are the functional at all? Nope and I've stayed in a lot of modern boutique hotels...this is a joke. On the plus side, the staff is really friendly and helpful. Just terrible rooms and for nearly 500 pound a night, quite a joke.

21,"Stayed one night just before Christmas to chill. Location is spot on, right in the middle. The obvious stylish design is undoubted, but does come with a few strange elements. We had a suite; the bath is in the centre of a large bathroom. There is a separate shower room and toilet behind the full length mirrored wall. However, the TV in the bathroom did not work and was stuck on a computer boot up screen. The bath tap control was lifted very lightly to use and the heavy top literally fell off as it was balanced and had come detached from the stem.  The bed was king size (hence the room choice), and was extremely comfortable. TV was functional and internet was good. However, considering the high room cost, there was no kettle, so one couldn't just make a brew. Feedback we received after our stay from hotel management has indicated that they were now going to install kettles in the rooms, following our communication; which is a good response. Room was very quiet and very well insulated. The corridors were extremely dark with black decor. The hotel bar was a weird layout with over-sized furniture, but funky I guess. I was surprised to be charged a £2 service charge for our drinks which we bought and paid for at the bar!, i guess he did have to pass my drink into my hand from his. Considering i have stayed in many London hotels, I would not rush back to this, but it may appeal to those desiring some funk.","Lots of show, less function",17.01.2017,3,mobile,N/A,4,36,13,20,2011,as couple,3,4,4,4,4,4,01-12-2016,male,25-34,Travel,0,No,N/A

23,"This hotel is in a great location in the heart of the west end with the main shopping areas within 5 minutes walk. The hotel reception is on the first floor with no signage at the entrance on the ground floor. The receptionist was very helpful and friendly and gave us lots of relevant information about our stay. The decor of the reception was very modern and slick in black and silver. Our suite was on the 6th floor the lift lobby is quite dark with black carpet and walls with silver glitter balls for decoration. The corridors are of the same colour scheme with very dim lighting which caused me a problem as I'm blind in one eye. The suite was however well lit with an open airy feel to it. When you first enter the room your entered into a lobby area which led into the bathroom. One wall was floor to ceiling mirror with hidden doors leading to a separate shower and toilet. Another wall was a glass picture wall of a woman lying on the floor whilst the other walls were the wardrobe and windows. The bedroom was in a separate room with a huge bed, chaise lounge, desk area and large TV. There were lots of extras in the room such as a mini bar, iPod docking station to play music, a multiple electric plug board including USB sockets to charge devices. Also 6 different settings for the lighting and an internet TV that you could watch whilst in the bath. The room was very clean with lots of toiletries etc. The bed was comfortable to sleep including the pillows which is a bonus. What the room lacked, in our opinion, was tea making facilities. The bath tap came off in my husbands hand and internet TV didn't work in the bathroom. We went to the bar at the end of our evening to find it quite dark again and full of very young people with a dj playing till 130am. The wine selection was poor by the glass and prices were more expensive than general bars in London. We got our own drinks from the bar despite there being waiting staff. We only stayed for 1 drink as the music was very monotonous and not to our taste. On check out we told the man on reception about the tap to which he replied you must be very strong!! We paid our bar bill only to discover they had charged us £2 service for going to the bar ourselves and carrying our own drinks to the table. Overall the hotel is clean, comfortable and central but maybe too modern for our taste as modern had replaced functionality in our opinion.

26,"I love the W at Leicester Square. Even withing the W hotel family, it is a lovable property - and you will love it too. The style of the hotel is very British and more: London style, with its design, and its diversity. Some suites are really worth writing about and probably you can try getting into one. Both WOW suites are really cool and spacious but the EWOW is a dream come true with a 5 meter rotating sofa, dj turntables and a full bar in the suite. That invites for memorable parties. The Insiders on property are very attentive and can support you finding the places in London, one usually does not get to or in.

29,"Checked in on May 13, 2016. Given this is London I was ready for the outrageous prices and had booked a entry level room at the W hotel. Being a Starwood member I requested to see what available for upgrade.....and a WoW suite was. I generally have a rule about not paying over a certain amount for hotels rooms, but if you want to throw away any idea of budgeting the Wow suite at the W in London is worth it.

I also had concerns about street and club noise (there is a club in the hotel). I was assured there would be no issue, but because I was unhappy with my room, i upgraded to a ""Wow suite""...and ..well...WOW. I couldn't have been happier with the room and the level of service.

33,"My family and I decided to book this hotel because of its good reputation in US. We went ahead and book it through booking.com because the price was reasonable. I am pretty sure I entered a room for 2 children and 2 adults under a double room- I have done the same thing in the previous bookings I had in US and there was never a problem. The hotel lobby is impressive with all the modern decorations and young vibe to it. Anyway, as we approached the concierge, the representative who helped us told us that the room that we booked has a small bed which will not fit our whole family and that I have only booked for 2 adults. We never got to even see the ""small bed"" she mentioned. She offered to upgrade into a suite for £85 more per night for 4 nights. Although we were in shock with the price, we were forced to take it because we didn't know where else to stay with 2 tired young children (3 and 6 YO). As we entered the room, the style was as expected from the photos; however, FILTHY! The floor was dirty, the bedsheets have stains, the walls have scratches. In addition, a gentleman who came in to bring an additional bed was disheveled, unkempt, no name tag and best of all- attempted to cover the additional bed with a bedsheet that has BIG BLACK shoe marks on it until we requested for another sheet. The appearance of this staff is unacceptable for a Starwood hotel like the W. That simple encounter made a huge impact of not only the W hotel but the whole London/ Europe experience. This was our first day and it was very disappointing! We thought our whole vacation will be ruined. Luckily, the additional price was adjusted by the managers and we thank them for that; however, we still felt unsafe for being swindled by the front desk rep and the disheveled staff who brought the bed so we ended up leaving the hotel and decided not to come back. 1 star to the managers for being so considerate and 0 star for the rest.",A BIG NO to this,10.06.2016,1,mobile,"San Francisco, California",1,3,5,2,2015,with family,3,4,4,4,4,4,01-05-2016,male,25-34,Travel,4,Yes,N/A

If you like sleeping in the bathroom or having a sink in the bedroom/sleeping area, then this is the hotel for you. I was in a ""Fabulous"" room which had a sink in the middle if the room. I later changed to a suite which at least had the sleeping area separate from the bathroom. However I soon discovered that the bathroom had no plugs and the sleeping area no mirrors so doing my hair was an annoyance each morning. The breakfast was terrible. Both in terms of quality and choices. I understand that the breakfast area was a temporary set up but the quality and choices were substandard. I know that W hotels like to present an overly ""cool"" image but the staff took it to another level. They were cold and rude and in some instances behaved as if I was imposing on their personal time. Also some guests prefer to be addressed by their surname.

I recommend upgrading to a higher level room where the bathroom is more spacious, as opposed to 2 rooms the size of a small closet each, one for the toilet and one for the shower. Get a suite, it really makes a difference! The concierge, Bernardo, was endlessly patient and helpful, as we had a million questions and requests.

Part of staying at a hotel is a nice breakfast, this wasn't included and we had to walk out and find breakfast elsewhere. Concierge suggested some nice places.But this costs a lot of time.The hotel is in a tower block with reception on 1st floor, they send you down to the street level where the doormen are. Toilets at reception area and down at streetlevel need some renovation and regular cleaning. On streetlevel they are also very dark, which is style of the hotel. Also corridors are very dark. Rooms are small but ok. Cleanliness could be improved. GREAT beds. We were upgraded to a studio suite, which was nice. Lovely soap, and showergel. Roomservice breakfast was perfectly on time, only they had forgotten the Danish Pastries. Internet works well. In the reception-lounge, there was a dj, I suppose every evening.

43,"You only have one chance to make a good first impression and this hotel disappointed. From the minute we arrived to check in, our opinion of this hotel got increasingly worse. Here are the details and why to avoid this hotel if you are looking for high end and value for money. Not only our opinion but of several others too, as we had several friends visit our room and asked their open opinions without telling ours. 1. Check in; as guests with high SPG status and other high status levels, we expect something special and to feel appreciated when checking in. The opposite happened, as we think the girl checking us in did not know nor understand status levels and started to try to charge us for an upgraded room. At the end of being asked to wait 15 minutes, twice (not offering something to drink except water that was sitting out all day in the open), we finally got a manager to handle the matter and take care of us. This gives a bad impression when a front desk person does not recognize loyalty programs nor even tried to go above and beyond to give good impressions to first time guests. We were not amused. 2. Hotel Hallways and public areas are so dark; you cannot see the number of your room on the card key. Done in black and dark grey, the halls are so dimly lit, (only with a faint light in front of each room), you can almost get dizzy just trying to find your room. NOT good for old persons, even young ones, with limited visibility or other sight problems. Also, the floors are dirty with hair and other lint on the floor. Probably because the halls are so dark, you can barely see the floor let alone your room door. 3. The room: was a so-called one-bedroom suite and it was one of the worst designed rooms I have ever stayed in. To be specific… Lights: so badly lit, there was more light under the bed than in the entire room, especially the bathroom. Limited lighting and so faint and dim, it was a challenge to see anything after dark. High-tech: There are so many electronic devices in the room but no instructions how to use them. The TV is so big, it blocks access to the sensor mini-bar and extra drawer, which would have been nice to use, had it been in the closet area.  Closet is completely wasted space and useless as the hanger section is smaller than a child’s closet. 2 sliding doors move back and forth, by pushing them with force, blocking the bathroom, as there is no door to the bathroom. Instead of drawers, there are strange pull-down covers to cubbyhole type storage, not big enough for normal clothes, very Kindergarten style. As this is the UK, hair dryers are not in the bathroom. In this room, it is located in one of the cubbyholes and the cord is short. You have to stand in front of the very dimly lit hall mirror, stretch the cable, located in the back of the cubbyhole while leaving the door open. Trying to even style your hair is impossible! Curtains are not automated and have to be pulled with effort to get them closed. Bending over the desk is awkward and hinders in trying to get them completely closed. An older person with arthritis will have difficulty doing this, as was tested by an 80 year old. Design: the Bed fills up the middle of the room so there is little space to walk between bed and oddly shaped desk. If the bed cover slid off during the night, be extra cautions not to trip and slide on the cover because you could easily hit your head on the desk, as the silky cover is dangerous on the wood floor. We had this happen but was lucky to fall onto the bed. The one bedroom suite is just a king size bed with a half sofa and table, not a separate room at all. One electric socket was found at the back of the room for the ironing board and iron but the light was so terrible, it was difficult to see the clothes being ironed.  4. Bathroom: A large glass shower fills the room and it gargles constantly as there is a problem with the plumbing.  5. A metal try with notepaper, pencil and an electrical cable for the TV is in the bathroom. HUH? What for? Does not make sense, as this is hazardous for electric cables to be near water. 6. Bathroom sink is shallow and rectangle and water splashes easily out and the sink does not drain as should. The counter stretches across the entire wall mirror. The sink is on the left and a built in TV is on the right. (UH ok, who watches TV in the shower?) The counter is about 90cm deep and is impossible to lean over to apply make up, shaving, putting in contacts, etc. Where there are 2 tube lights, one over the sink and the other in front of the TV, forget trying to get close to the mirror. They are very low light and yellow in color. There is NO make-up/close up mirror so good luck applying make up. No other mirrors in the room are available for such necessities. (There are more mirrors in the corridors and lounge areas then in the rooms.) 7. Toilet: is located in a very small closet that is difficult to turn around in. It is stuffy and can really stink when doing a smelly job. NO fan in the bathroom either. NOTE: since there is no sink to wash hands after such “jobs), imagine how much bacteria and germs are on the toilet doors? I am sure they have never been wiped down and disinfected. YUK! 8. Robes and slippers are provided but the robes must be for children as they are short and the ties are a challenge for someone not a size 6-8. 9. Breakfast: located at ground floor, then having to climb stairs to first floor would not be acceptable for someone with limited mobility. Table was sticky and dirty. As the staff was friendly, the freshly cooked meal satisfied, the melon was not ripe and the smoked fish, half smoked. Is it worth the extra price, depends upon if you are a foody or not. 10. Location: directly on Leicester Square, in the heart of Red Carpet and theater events. But take note: depending upon where your room is located, it could be noisy on all sides due to street traffic, garbage collection and loud street performers at all hours of the night. 2 positives were noted: 1. Bathroom products were from Bliss. Great brand and provided were the following:a. Facewash b. Shampoo c. Conditioner d. Toothbrush (just one) e. Shaver f. Eye make up remover pads g. Shower cap h. Fingernail file and sewing kit i. Body lotion 2. Bed comfort: very comfortable bed and pillows though the bed was ripped and it is the topper pad that makes it cushy. (I wonder how many times they change these)? So, to finish my review, to pay £300 for this room is NOT value for money nor does it come close. I would not stay here if choosing again and rather would choose a 3 star hotel, offering coffee and tea in the room and free internet with better service.

44,"We booked a suite for a couple of nights in London to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.The check-in staff were pleasant but very slow. They had no idea what was part of the package I ordered, they didn't tell me about any of the services the hotel provided and couldn't even be bothered to tell me where breakfast was going to be served the next morning.The suite we booked came with a steam-room, projection (cinema) facilities in room and fancy electric curtains. It was a quite large room. However, the view was dismal, it looked out on to the Gym. The room itself was possibly once very nice, but has deteriorated and given the cleanliness, the hotel seems not to care. There were a number of ugly marks on the walls, floors and fittings. Maybe not the hotels fault but the greasy finger prints on the lighting, dust on the shelves and TV most certainly was the hotels fault. Many of the fittings: mini-bar, cupboards beneath the TV and a door, were broken or on their last legs. Come 10'o clock at night, it was time to draw the curtains. However the computer tablet that controlled them was broken, which meant the curtains could not be drawn. An engineer came and was unable to repair the faulty tablet. He knew this immediately because there was 'no master tablet'. Symptomatic of poor management I suspect. Why no 'Master tablet'? seems pathetic.The duty manager, after initially saying there were no more rooms, phoned me to inform me we could move to another a suite and someone would come to help in 20 minutes. 40 minutes later -- nobody. One more phone call by me and a stressed member of staff flustered into the room and offered me the keys to another suite. The second suite was much smaller, had fewer facilities, no steam room, no projection facilities and was clearly a good deal cheaper than the room I had booked. No apology, no acknowledgement from the management, no indication of how this would be reflected in the bill. Again, symptomatic of poor or inadequate management.The check-out was painfully slow (10:30am) and seemingly no knowledge of room down grade. I was told a manager would call me, but as yet -- nothing.In all, if it wasn't for the location, it would be very hard to recommend this hotel, especially since my wife was more than little heart broken by their lackadaisical attitude to guests and the service they provide to guests. It felt we were very much taken for granted.For context: I've stayed in hotels from Cairo to Tokyo, Boston to San Francisco, Paris to Port Louis. I travel for a living.

When I was back around 2PM, I was told that the room I was getting was occupied by a premier customer, i.e., he/she would not check out until 4PM, after which they would have to clean the room. Needless to say, I was livid. Fortunately, the manager decided to help out and I was placed in one of the junior suites with a steam bath (what a pleasure for the latter!). The room is very modern and nice with loads of amazing features. In particular, the large movie screen is a treat for those who like to watch TV. Me, not so much. All room amenities are driven from a little tablet. Unfortunately, some were not functioning properly or at all. However, nothing really necessary failed (I just really wanted to try the bed shaking while turning on the TV...). One rather odd thing: The windows of the room open up to the gym, after which you have windows to the outside. While you are one flight up from the gym, this also means that you can hear people running or pumping iron. This is rather annoying, if you want to be in peace. Furthermore, the windows are not mirrored from the outside. Me waving naked to a couple working out (I *had* to test) resulted in them waiving back... And running off. Housekeeping is thorough and not intrusive. Overall, post check-in, the service was excellent.  Annoyances: For the price paid, the movies and wifi should be complementary. Really? In 2015? Also: if you take a shower and are not careful, you will cause a tsunami in the bathroom. Not fun – housekeeping had to come to lend me a hand with that lake. Will I come back? Probably not. The location is extremely noisy (next to Chinatown) and there are just too many people around. Furthermore, the price paid did not really give me the experience I expected. I have been to many hotels in my life and I must say that this did not impress too much for the category.",Modern hotel with some odd quirks in a too busy location,23.07.2015,4,Desktop,Texas,6,1008,506,360,2008,on business,3,2,4,4,5,3,01-07-2015,male,35-49,"Art and Architecture Lover, Vegetarian, Foodie, Like a Local",1,Yes,Screening Suite
50,"I'm a big fan of W Hotels generally so don't tend to review them that often as the reviews would normally be along the same lines. However, this Friday myself and my 2 young daughters stayed in the Screening Suite and it.is.awesome. A large room.. large separate bathroom with a large 2 shower steam sauna.. the main bedroom overlooks the gym (kind of bizarre) but then, hit a button on the touch screen remote and the bedroom changes. Sheer blinds plus black-out blinds come down, the curtains wrap around the whole room and a 3 meter projection screen descends from the ceiling. The lighting all changes, the projector behind the bed boots up and suddenly you're sat in your own private cinema. The bed is even linked up to the surround sound system so it shakes along with the subwoofer and most impressively the lighting of the room is dynamic and changes along with the colours on the screen fully immersing you in the film you're watching. For example, if what's happening on screen is underwater the entire room is bathed in blue. The entire library of a few hundred films including a lot of new releases is free and unlimited so after a quick trip to M&M World (helpfully next door to The W London) we were stocked up and ready for a night of movies in our own cinema. Very cool! The usual price of a W London room is around £300 and the Screening suite £500. I'm not claiming its a cheap room but if you're paying the money for 5 Star London anyway, that's a bit of a bargain of an extra premium for what you get. Bear in mind a standard room at The Shangri-La London is around the £450 mark. The only gripe. The touch screen remote for the whole system is dated and difficult to use like all the old touchscreen remotes used to be. Modern touch screen technology has advanced massively and this needs updating or alternatively, and I imagine this is easy to do, an app for your smart phone or iPad or even an in-room iPad as many top hotels now offer. More generally on the subject of technology, Starwood (owners of The W brand) are really pushing this keyless entry system, using your phone instead of a key. Sounds great to me however as far as I can tell it doesn't work on Android phones (I've tried it on 2 including the new Galaxy S6, with the app claiming keyless isn't compatible with either handset) thus alienating half the smart phone market.

51,"There were great aspects of this hotel - the fabulous service from the entire staff, the wonderful onsite restaurants, the super central location. These things I would really like to point out clearly because I don't want that to be discounted as it is such an important part of the trip. But I am a little confused by the layout of the rooms and the way the hotel was designed. We stayed in a Marvelous Suite on the 4th floor. The room is divided into two rooms, which is over 500 square feet when added together - but about half of the space is really not usable. When you walk in, you walk into a room that has a HUGE tub overlooking a flat screen TV and a large vanity that takes up most of the room. The toilet is behind a mirrored door - feels like a closet and the same goes for the shower. And I guess if I was a bath taker, I'd be in heaven, but who has time for a bath? if they allocated even a little more space to the shower and toilet, it might make some sense but I am still trying to figure this out. The vanity has no outlets near it. This is very confusing too. How do you use a hair dryer or curling iron there? Well, not to worry if you are using the hotel hair dryer, because that's plugged into the wall... directly from the safe in your closet. Huh? So I am standing there, blow drying my hair, not able to use the vanity, which takes up 50% of the working space in the room. Go figure. The bedroom in the suite is more standard - nice bed, nice desk and a sofa. Ok. Perhaps you eliminate the huge vanity and the tub from the other room and put the sofa there? I don't know - but I do know that whatever they've got going on right now did not cut it for me. We didn't really have too many problems with the noise from Leicester Square. In fact, it was really manageable. Except for a really loud Saturday night (4th of July) when drunken revelry from the square went to new heights. Still, for having the location that we did, there are tradeoffs. Being so central offset the loudness for us on that one random night. Again - I cannot say enough nice things about the outgoing and amazingly sweet and accommodating staff. I would say if that is your primary concern - then by all means - please book here - you will love them. However, if you want a functional and efficiently designed room that doesn't trade sleekness for usability, I don't know if I would recommend this. For the record, I have been to many W hotels and I tend to love them. This one just didn't meet my expectations with the room (which is usually one of my favorite things!) as others have. Service was consistent and impeccable.",Oddest Use of Space at a W,05.07.2015,3,Desktop,"Ahsburn, VA",3,9,26,5,2006,as couple,3,4,4,4,4,5,01-07-2015,female,35-49,Travel,1,No,Marvelous Suite
52,"We had one of the three Screening Suites, room 736. The blackout bllnds have gaps so don’t fully black the room out. The room overlooks the gym (so you have no view) and there is gym noise early in the morning. The room seemed poorly soundproofed, we could hear loud music late at night. No charging port or plug socket of any kind on one side of the bed. Lighting - there are pendant lights on one side of the room but not on the other. The mood lighting option didn't seem operational at all. The lighting control panels on the wall are very complicated and it took us about half an hour to figure out how to turn the bathroom lights off for sleeping. The various tech (bluetooth speakers, phones) have bright lights on them which is bad at night.  There is only one chair and no side table in bedroom which seems very strange in such a large room. No direct way to stream own media on the cinema system - in spite of us having called in advance and been told this would be possible. The iPhone dock does not have capability to connect newer models - again in spite of having called in advance of staying to enquire about connectivity options and being told both styles were catered for only to discover they weren’t. BIG PROBLEM - the film picture quality on the projection screen is APPALLING - for a room sold on it’s cinema-like capabilities this is the biggest let down. The ontrol console for lights/tv/etc very laggy and frustrating to use. The control for the aircon for the bathroom is in the entryway, behind a door that’s shut once you’re in the room and so hard to find. The cubby holes in the entry way could do with coat hooks. No tea/coffee making facilities - apparently these are available 'on request' but for a room at this price ought to be included as standard. Dangerous bathroom floor - the runners for the sliding door are not protected. Small metal posts sticking out the floor should be covered, it was too easy to accidentally walk on them and this could very easily have caused serious injury. The mattress pad on the bed is not full length, there is a large gap at the back under the pillows. The headboard is VERY squeaky if you move around in your sleep. The pillows were very poor and unsupportive. The additional foldaway bed supplied was broken and missing a support and collapsed on itself. The condition of the room was generally far lower than you would expect for a suite - lots of paint chips and scuffs etc. Music when played through airplay - the speakers seem rather low quality, bass tones of music are lost entirely and the in bed system is not activated to enrich the sound further. The sound quality is better on the small bluetooth speaker box than the expensive inbuilt system. The wood floor in the bathroom tracks in any dirt on shoes from outside - the hallway would be better served with a small bench area so shoes can be removed before fully entering the room. The shower room does not have a drain at the door so water seeps into the bathroom area. We were delayed checking in to the room because it was not ready. We requested additional toilet paper etc during our stay from housekeeping which was never provided. All in all, I cannot recommend this hotel.

56,"Checked in early March for a one night stay as SPG platinum members. This was our post valentines treat as we had not been able to do much in Feb so hubby used a suite night award and we were really looking forward to the stay. On arrival check in was terrible, first told we had a room only, then we had a suite but could not check in until 4:30pm, then told 5pm, then 6pm. The staff appeared to need some training in basic customer service and SPG programme.  Never the less the staff at the bar were amazing, really friendly and apologetic about our delay on check in, and the manager on that evening was Fab, came up to our room listened to our feedback and made sure we had no more hiccups for the rest of our stay.  Room: We stayed in the WOW Suite and it was defiantly WOW. Lots of space for central London and great toiletries etc. the bathroom was pretty awesome.  Food: We had room service and the breakfast in the morning, bother were lovely, the SPG breakfast was one of the best continental buffets we have had, lovely fresh food and plenty of choice (for those who like a hot meal you could top up to this for a little extra). Location: Cant really get much better than smack in the middle of Leicester Square - view from the room was amazing.  This was our first experience of the W chain as we are not very trendy !! but we did enjoy it and decor is very cool. Overall we had a lovely stay, missed out of all 5 stars due to the check in team but would definitely recommend a stay for someone looking for a trendy place in London.

57,"Why do I always forget that W's range between hip <---> straight up dance party? This one is by far the danciest one I've stayed in. Not a bad thing! Just be sure that's your thing. On the plus side, it's actually fun dancing music, like 50 Cent and LL Cool J and Robin Thicke. I haven't heard any house music yet which is fantastic. Rooms are... efficient. Polka dots and quilts are the theme here. If the walls aren't mirrored, they are padded, just in case all that dancing has you wobbly or you need to check your lipstick. Doormen are wonderful and helpful. They're also tall and handsome.  On to logistics - A bit of a nightmare trying to get a car to the hotel, especially late on a Saturday night. Didn't think that one through. It took 30 minutes to get to the hotel from Knightsbridge thanks to pedestrians and closed roads. If you can manage it, take the tube or walk. You're only a few minutes from Picadilly or Leicester Sq stops. Location is on the edge of Chinatown, surrounded by lots of theaters, a few minutes walk to the National Portrait Gallery and Trafalger Square, Harrods, etc, etc.  Ask for an inside room, or a room where the facade lights (they change color) don't light your suite up like a disco ball.",Smack center of all the party-things,08.03.2015,4,Desktop,"Delafield, Wisconsin",6,97,50,89,2009,on business,3,4,4,3,5,5,01-03-2015,female,35-49,Travel,0,no,N/A

61,"It has been along time since my last stay at the W and things have greatly improved. Almost awarded 5 stars but there are still some bad points which hold it back. Upon arrival- it is indeed very trendy and has a bit of a weird feel due to many people coming for the bar so had to make my way through a large group having their ID's checked. Lifts card operated, but staff let you up without hesitation. Have only ever stayed in the suites so am not sure how representative they are of the rooms, but ours was absolutely beautiful- with a Sanderson/ St Martins Lane feel to the suite and very well and tastefully decorated in a modern, elegant style with all the mod cons and no expense spared. However- it hosts the strangest floorplan I have ever encountered. For some unknown reason when you enter the suite you walk directly into the bathroom. In every other suite I have ever been in you open the door to the bedroom or a living space- here you walk straight into the toilet and bath... and have to walk through the bathroom to get to the bedroom. And no door in between the two. So if you ordered room service you would have to walk your food through the bathroom! The safe is also in the bathroom area, which also has a large bench and barstool in it. What a strange layout! Giving no privacy at all if there are two of you staying. For a £500+ a night suite it seems a fatal and unforgivable flaw in the design.

62,"This was my third visit to the W in Leicester square, and I can say that I have enjoyed every visit. I can concur with the majority of the other reviews in that the hotel is absolutely perfect for visiting London especially the nightlife around Leicester square; and it is also excellent as a romantic escape for a couple, to wine and dine in the local restaurants. The hotel is very modern and stylish, which I like, but the rooms deserve a special mention. I have loved every room that I have stayed in. I can see how some people may find a certain lack of privacy with the design, but that has never bothered myself or my partner. It is true that the lower rooms get a lot of noise from the bar/club in the evenings, so if you want to avoid this book a room on a higher floor for a good nights sleep (the beds are really comfortable). This time we specifically booked the screening suite for two nights to give us ample film time as well as evenings eating out. Its large, has a bath, hidden toilet, and a dedicated sauna room with 2 showers. We made good use of the sauna, and really kicked back and relaxed. But what really makes the room special is that at a touch of a button, the blackout blinds come down, the curtains close, and a large screen drops down ready to screen whatever you want. Together with the room, you get a film package that allows you to watch any film they have. Fantastic.  But there were a few issues, the major one being that the projector would overheat. It did this repeatedly, and just shut down. It looked like the weekend would be a disaster. The staff were good in responding but had no ability to fix the issue as it was all maintained by a separate company. They did offer us an upgrade to a better room but it was not a screening suite, so we declined. In the end we found our own solution which was to set the air con colder than desired, but to then snuggle down in the bed to keep warm. So not ideal, and frankly speaking a screening suite where the projector does not work in all temperatures is not acceptable.  There were a few other smaller gripes in that the film selection was not huge, and in some cases, they would not have an English version of a film (Grand Budapest Hotel), which was a bit odd. Plus the touch screen remote controller was very clunky and unresponsive. All in all we had an excellent weekend and worked around the problems. I do not know if we just got unlucky with the projector or if this is indicative of a wider issue; hopefully not because it is a superb idea and an amazing experience if you love films.","Screening suite, fit for purpose?",05.11.2014,4,Desktop,"London, United Kingdom",3,11,11,50,2013,as couple,4,4,4,5,4,5,01-09-2015,male,35-49,Travel,0,No,Screening Suite

64,Was previously here in September and the stay was wonderful. We decided to go back for Christmas holidays and enjoy the city. So festive full of life as usual. We arrived to hotel and was greeted by Drew ...at first was going ok but quickly went sour. He was quick to tell us what we couldn't do instead of just finishing our situation. He frustrated both me and my husband x10. We upgraded to a suite on 6th floor was roomier but still same set up as a standard room maybe a few sqaure ft larger but still pretty much to same. Conjested even. My girls didn't have trouble moving around the room they actually loved the red sofa. The shower door needs revamping water lets out on the floors with the people try closed which in turns creates a mess and towels to be used to avoid falling. One thing was totally grossed out about was the ball of RED hair (my hair is far from red lets be clear) that was in my robe pocket ... I discoverd this on day 6/7 I even took a pic cus I'm sure that's unbelievable. One other thing that I think they should take into consideration for the suites is that they have two doors that enter into the suite room itself which makes it very difficult to hear when someone is knocking on the door. Install some door bells or something ...very easy fix. We had to constantly prop one door open just o make sure we didn't miss room service or housekeeper. When we intially got inside the room the first day or two we had received called that room service came and we didn't answer. Was because we couldn't hear.

69,"If you like modern, funky design and not a fan of 'boutique heritage' property - this is a great choice. We stayed here on two separate occasions on Thurs & Fri nights and Sun & Mon stays in September 2014. I saw a lot of reviews here mentioning noise from the night club downstairs, but I can't say we heard anything that bad. It is a city hotel and it's only 7 storeys high, so yes, there's some urban noise, but nothing that made me uncomfortable or even made me think about it. We weren't at the property on the Sat though. I really liked free breakfast trolley with delicious bites that hotel provides for those who wake up before the restaurant is opened or for those on the go. It's near the reception and they have croissants, bananas, tea, coffee and some fruit and juices on offer. There's also cucumber, lemon or berry water on offer all day in the lobby of the hotel - healthy and yummy! Buffet breakfast is top quality! Only cold selection is included in the stay, but we truly were full every time. Bircher muesli - fantastic, berries and fruit - fresh and sweet, smoked salmon and pastries were also great! The choice is not that big, but everything is top quality. You can of course enjoy some hot options for extra $$. Location is central and right near China Town. It's not the cleanest part of the town, but it has a lot of trendy restaurants nearby including Flesh & Buns created by ex Zuma's head chef Ross Shonhan and a short stroll to pretty much anything you need. Rooms are funky, but a lot smaller than other W properties. On our first stay we had one the top suites, but it was of very weird and uncomfortable config - you walk into a bathroom from the hotel corridor and then proceed to the bedroom and the lounge area. As a result every time we had visitors, we had to rush and clean the bathroom as guests had to walk through it. But even for us alone - it was just mess of used towels, laundry and make up in your face, every time you walk into the room. The idea is cool, but the reality is cruel - it's simply inconvenient.

71,"I was upgraded to the Spa Suite with my SPG Platinum status, this room had the nicest bathroom of any hotel I've been to, so far. It's a weird layout, when you walk into the room, you're in the bathroom, which is huge. Then you continue on to the bedroom. Luckily it's a huge bathroom but the shower and toilet are hidden behind closed doors. The steam shower was enormous, I love steam showers, eventually I'll remodel one of my bathrooms at home to add one. My wife loved one of the decorative pillows on the bed, we asked about purchasing one but they didn't sell them. The breakfast buffet was very good, it was included with our status, I'm not sure what it would cost, but it couldn't be cheap. The location was in a busy area, adjacent to Chinatown. We walked to dinner both nights, found a descent Chinese place the first night and a really good Italian place the second night.

The room is small, toilet and shower are all in the box even it is a studio suite the toilet and shower are inside a box.

If the hotel room is small, better use mirror than cheesey curtain deco plus, The doorman wont help your luggages unless you really want to go for a night club. This time, at least improving is they finally put a desk on the ground level (A desk does not mean they can help) for your luggages or check - in. They seem to run the place like a night club than a hotel. Will they really consider find another entrance for the club goers and hotel guests ? Another thing, when coming to a hotel with baggages, usually someone will help you ?

75,"If you are interested in the London nightlife, this is a great place to stay. We used our SPG and suite upgrades, so were treated to a terrific room on the 6th floor. I think if we were lower then my review would not be as shining, since even on the 6th floor we could hear the music until early hours of the morning. When we arrived, the reception staff was extremely pleasant. We were a little early, so we sat at the bar while our room was being prepared and were also treated like longtime customers.  The room was great, with an exceptional view and a really modern décor. The sink in the middle of the main room was a little awkward, but no big deal. The bellboy offered to show us around the room when we first got there. I recommend taking him up on it (I passed), since we didn’t figure out all of the lights and sliding doors until the 3rd day. My wife and I were on our honeymoon, and the W made it extra nice with a bottle of champagne and some cupcakes. Really a nice touch on top of all the extras we were already enjoying in the room. Coming back to the hotel in the evenings was always a little awkward, since there is the night club-style velvet rope you have to get through.

Incredible guest service had begun even before we arrived when the welcome manager John Kelly upgraded us to a suite which was a couple of categories higher of what I had booked. Many thanks to Coen and John for honoring our SPG status. The hotel is funky and has unusual design of each corner of it, including rooms. The concept is cool and sexy, so you do t really feel like in a hotel rather than in a nightclub/lounge. The attitude of the staff is informal but polite. I like the way they speak to the guests- open, sincere and feels like they are enjoying what they do. They remembered my name, room number and our preferences. The security at the doors were also polite despite their looks :)  I want to specifically mention everyone at the reception, especially the lady from Algeria (dont recall the name), concierge, bellboys, club manager Yuriy.  Speaking about the night club in the hotel, if you enjoy night life, this club is worth visiting. It is really small, but cosy, great music and mostly glamorous crowd.

For perspective, I'm an SPG Platinum and always stay at a Starwood Hotel in London -- I visit almost monthly from San Francisco, so have gotten to know the properties very well. For the first time, I chose to stay at the W. I had been hesitant because I had heard that the rooms were small and of course have seen how many people are in and around Leicester Square had given me concern about noise. I was greeted at the desk as if they had been eagerly awaiting my arrival. I was upgraded to a Wow Suite -- among the best hotel rooms I've ever had -- certainly among the very best suites at W Hotels in the chain (including the great Asian properties and many in the US). I mostly want to point out the extremely good service that is provided by the W Insider at this property. Jess is amazing, on top of everything and a huge advocate for her loyal guests. Jess is just one of many incredible W Insiders who are connected on a global basis. Final point on food, had both breakfast and lunch at Spice Market. It's as good as the original in NYC.

We booked the standard room as knew we would be spending minimal time in the room itself, previously we've had the screening suite which I absolutely love.....the bed shakes from within for effect when the movie gets louder!?! Watching Superman was awesome! I would absolutely say this is a place for couples and friends who want to have fun particularly the standard rooms as the music is quite loud in them which wasn't a problem for us as we knew what to expect. The rooms are quirky which I love and having the bathroom counter in the middle of the room makes it feel spacious and really very functional at the same time.

82,"For context, I write as an SPG-Platinum . . . and this was a miserable experience. I used ""suite upgrade"" nights for my stay, and was given a great space . . . that turned out to be directly over the lobby-nightclub. I returned from a long day of travel getting to London and dinner at 1200 am to the single loudest hotel room I have ever been in my life (and by a lot). I have literally been in bathrooms at nightclubs that were quieter than this room. The Manager who came up was very nice, but the hotel was full . . . so I'm screwed until they 'turned down' the music at 130 am. The notion that they ever sell this room to anybody they haven't confirmed is on a bachelor party is a complete joke. So they move me the next night to a room on the 6th floor that is supposed to be quieter, but hey guess what you cannot escape the nightclub at this hotel. I slept with earplugs in every night, basically miserable. I am mid-30s and I like nightclubs, and I like trendy hotels. But this is an abomination.

Creepy! Well, the room (I was upgraded to a studio suite, one of only 4 they have in the hotel ) was another shocker - W (London) tried really hard to make the room cool but ended up cluttering it with useless pieces of junk that comes in the way. I spent 15 minutes just trying to figure out all the mood lights and controls. Beautiful TV was non functioning as the remote was dead and it lacked manual controls. Cordless phones looked cool but were totally useless due to high noise interference. The bathroom and closets were very oddly designed and placed. There was a useless pillar in the middle of my suite blocking useful area. Whoever designed the layout this room should be barred from practicing, enough said!

84,"I've been a fan of Starwood brand hotels for years, especially the W chain. This was actually the first time I've ever been disappointed by a stay on one of their properties. I've stayed at this hotel two times now (total of four nights) with the hope that it would be ""better next time"". I do believe I've given up. The first time I stayed, I was traveling with a Milan-based model as we were in London to shoot for a publication. Being an SPG Platinum member, I used two of my suite night upgrades for our stay (booking three weeks in advance). I received a confirmation email from SPG stating that we had been upgraded to the WOW suite. Upon arrival to the hotel, reception said that we were only reserved for the original room we booked and even though I cordially requested they upgrade us, we were denied and ended up staying in the original room. All while never being reimbursed for my two suite night awards. The second time I stayed at this hotel I was traveling alone and had repeated the suite night award request as before. I checked in at reception at 3:30pm and was given the keys to a WOW Suite. Great, right? Wrong. As a Platinum member you have the option of late check out at 4pm, and that's what the current guest was using. No problem, I'll just wait in the lobby. Staff was quick to accomodate me and give me two drink tickets for use at the bar. Over the course of the next hour I had two rum & cokes. I went back to the reception desk and was told that they weren't done cleaning the room yet and that I would be notified once they were done. I requested another drink ticket while I waited and the staff was more than happy to oblige. I had two more rum and cokes then reapproached the reception desk. ""Sorry sir, the room still isn't ready yet."" It was nearly 7pm at this point. I said this is starting to become ridiculous and no I didn't want anymore drink tickets because I didn't want to be sloshed before 8pm. I sat back down and 30 minutes later was finally informed that the room was good to go. I took a long shower and explored the room a bit. The quality and style was definitely up to par, if not exceeding, that of other W properties I have stayed at. I went downstairs and met up with a friend who lives in London and since I had already been put on the guest list to Wyld (the club inside the W) we decided to go check it out. The atmospere was fun and energetic but I have to say the drinks were overpriced. The bartender hooked us up with the alcohol to cola ratio in our drinks though after I gave him a generous initial tip. The beds aren't the most comfortable in the world but they provide a good night's sleep. As I said, the interior decor of the rooms is very cool and modern and I could look out and see people around the Chinatown district. It was a good view.

87,"This is my 4th time to this hotel. The location is unbeatable for access to Central London restaurants, theaters, shopping, and nightlife. During Check-In we had problems. Around 5 days before, I had submitted a Your24 request for a 9am check-in, which was confirmed, however I was upgraded about 4 hours later to a suite. This was my own fault - I forgot to resubmit the Your24 request. As such, we arrived around 9am and could not check in but was assured the suite was good, so we waited. And waited. And waited. The staff were great, but when we were unable to check in at 3:20pm (after going to the gym, walking around London a bit tired, etc), we became frustrated. The check-in agent went behind reception to speak to the manager - and came back with good news that we were upgraded (again) to a WOW Suite on the 7th floor, which was available immediately. This was a nice recovery and the manager, Andrew (who I recognized from my last stay) came out, apologized and mentioned it was the same suite I stayed in last time. Indeed it was - this is very large room with 2 bathrooms, a bath, 2-3 person shower, large amenities, large sofa, separate bedroom. It's a great room with interesting features and a fantastic view of Wardour St & Leicester Sq. The rest of the stay was uneventful and enjoyable. Ice was delivered to the room promptly. The gym was as good as I had remembered it (and complimentary). As reported, the 'bouncers' outside the hotel will block the entrance and ask if you are a guest each time you come back, but that didn't bother us. The bed is (still) great and we had a wonderful 2 nights here. My only other comment was that the room was not cleaned very well - I had spilled a few (dry) pieces of my falling-apart backpack on the sofa - this was not cleaned or vacuumed on Day 2, and overall the room just didn't look spotless like it should. This, and the check-in mixup, resulted in 4 - otherwise I would have given them a 5 for this trip.

90,"There were many great things about this hotel and many not-so-great (but only because of our situation, not the hotel's fault). For starters, the hotel is in the middle of it all....call it the Times Square of London. For convenience and ease of travel, it gets an A+. It did however take us a very long time to navigate the streets as we landed quite late on a Saturday night. The hotel in on a very narrow street so we couldn't be dropped of right in front and I have to manage with a double stroller, 2 kids and the luggage on my own. That was a bit of a bummer but the friendly and accommodating staff quickly made me forget it all. We checked in at about 10:30pm on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, the check-in is on the same level as the bar. The receptionist couldn't hear us, we couldn't hear them over the loud music....it was a bit annoying. Plus, I felt like a total loser with all the girls walking in with their high heels and Saturday attire- lol. Here, I was coming off an international flight with an infant and pre-schooler, my stroller was broken by the airline, I was a wreck.....I definitely felt so uncool checking in at what was essentially the bar- hahaha. Our first room, a suite, was very nice though the layout was quite weird and we weren't able to fit a crib in. We also had problems with the ventilation system. Cigarette smoke was coming up from the outside into the room. We switched rooms, to a smaller room with 2 beds which actually worked out better. Even though it wasn't a suite, the layout was better. There were a couple of strange things that are a matter of design that I didn't care for. The shower and bathroom are hidden behind a panel of mirrors which are part of the room (so, no separate bathroom) and the sink was also just part of the room (very shallow sink). Since I had no sink (sink was flat and only about 2 inches deep) or bathtub it was tough to bathe the baby. Also, the lights wouldn't go completely out....there was some blue glow lighting that stayed on the whole time around perimeter of room. The only way to make it all dark was to take out the keycard which also meant no AC/Heat (not a big deal bc of the time of year we didn't need it). The staff is top-notch. The guy who checked us in sent up a complimentary grilled cheese and fries for my daughter and they made sure we were comfortable after our long flight. It was definitely much appreciated, We also had an incident with the mirrored door to the bathroom. My daughter's toe got stuck underneath and it lifted up the nail. She did end up losing the nail but the staff was very responsive sending up medical supplies, 2 staff members and following up several times to see how she was doing. We went out that day and when we came back they had left a tray of cookies, milk, a personalized princess coloring book, crayons and souvenir bear with a note saying they hoped she was feeling better. We ordered room service several times. Food was unreal- so good. The breakfast pastry baskets were divine, cappuccino delicious, eggs and pancakes.....it was all so, so, so good. Overall, I would stay here again but probably not with small kids. I think this hotel is great for younger travelers or travelers seeking more of a hip, clubby feel.

My reservations were capably handled by George (W Welcome Desk manager) What did I enjoy about my stay? - the tastefully appointed screening suite with its uber-cool ""cinema mode"" - the Bliss luxe toiletries - the sWeat gym - breakfast at Spice Market (I was hunting for Kitchen, but was pleasantly surprised by Spice Market instead) - the centralized location (between Leiceister Square and Picadilly Circus tube stations) - the ultra comfortable W bed - the ever friendly service crew aka 'talents' What could have been improved?- the absence of a welcome amenity was acutely felt; most of the other W hotels I have resided always leave a welcome surprise upon check-in (e.g. a cake, pastries, a cocktail etc) - the turn-down service was a tad anaemic and lacked the WOW factor - the lack of a jacuzzi although this was prominently advertised on their online folio https://www.starwoodhotels.com/preferredguest/property/features/attraction_detail.html?propertyID=3464&attractionId=1006341146; I was later told that the aforementioned jacuzzi was a ""typo""! - the lack of an Android version of their W Hotels app - the greatest shock was the unavailability of the iconic W tee-shirts - I was told that they were no longer being produced as their W store was closing down!

92,I should let you know first off that this was going to be a 4 star review but since the staff at this W demand customers to be happy with there stay it turned out to be a 5+ rating for my partner and self. We started out in a Cool Corner suite but when we booked online it stated there was a bathtub in the room and we really wanted one. Upon arrival into the room there was only a walk in shower:( So we called the front desk which they apologized since the UK web site and US web site state different descriptions of this room. The manager Matthew Facey was unable to move us that night but said the following day he could promise a bathtub and breakfast was on him anything we wanted :). So the next day after some shopping and site seeing we returned to move into our new room. We went to our room and was shocked to see we had been upgraded to a WOW Suite (5 class levels above our room type). I was beside myself and very pleased. The manager Matthew even came up to deliver our luggage plus making sure we were 100% happy. We will be sure to visit this hotel again in the future trips to London.

96,"My partner is a Platinum SPG member so he got us a room here during our recent vacation in London leveraging (a whole lotta) points. We flew in from a vacation in Prague on Saturday afternoon and left for the USA on the following Tuesday morning. Neither of us had been to London before. First, the hotel is located right in the times square of London! AWESOME LOCATION! (right beside the M&M store.) We were able to take the tube directly from Heathrow to Leicester Square (piccadilly line btw) without issue and walk only a couple of blocks to the hotel. There was always doormen waiting with a friendly smile and pleasant word. The check in desk was quite speedy and helpful as well as the Whatever Whenever desk. We actually stayed in a Fabulous Room for the first night and then the following night we were upgraded to a Cool Corner Suite. The Fab room was nice but it was weird having the bathroom inside of the room (the toilet and shower are in separate spaces but the sink sits in the middle of the room beside the bed). In the Cool room, things were similar but quite different. So the external room door actually opens to a small foyer area where you have to walk through another door to get into the room which was great privacy! You walk into the ""bathroom area"" where there's still a sink in the middle of the room with a longer counter top, a tub (with waiting bubble bath waiting AND a flat screen embedded in the wall so you can relax and watch TV. The shower and toilet were still separate and there is a wall of mirrors which make the shower and toilet blend into the room seamlessly. It's very hip and trendy as well as space efficient. Then you walk into a separate room where there was the bed, a desk, chaise lounge with tables/ottomans, another television and floor to ceiling windows overlooking the square! It was great! I'd definitely recommend the hotel and location to anyone going to London for the first time or just looking to be in a great location with food/drink/entertainment options at your fingertips!

97,I stayed at this W with my wife and two young daughters. We were very pleased overall with service and experience. Ahead of the stay I contacted the hotel and explained what we were looking for. The manager replied that the Cool Corner room wasn't going to work but gave us an upgrade to Junior Suite. The room wasn't ready when we arrived but they gave us a loaner. When we got to our room they had set up a camp bed for my daughter complete with a few presents and some candy. She felt so special. Location is very central between Leicester Square and Chinatown and yes it is noisy and busy. If that isn't what you are looking for stay elsewhere but if you are just worried about noisy rooms simply call ahead and get something on the Chinatown side. One last word on staff. It is rare to find a hotel where everyone is this friendly and effective. From bell-service at the door through to the maids cleaning the rooms not forgetting Whatever Whenever and check-in. Even the bouncers (main entrance feels like a nightclub late at night) were friendly). Bravo to whoever manages personnel.

From the moment we arrived, we felt welcome. Every staff person we encountered was friendly and helpful, welcoming us back and making sure we didnt lack for anything. I checked with the front desk and was able to reserve a suite for the end of our trip. We also used the hotel's car service to and from the airport. With three people the cost was only slightly more than taking the express train and then a cab. We had the same driver, our request, each time. Yes, on the weekend the place has a club atmosphere, but not in a way that is bothersome to other guests. The one minor issue with our room was quickly addressed and fixed.

The bar area looks like it hasn't been updated since the 1980s with uncomfortable seats. Our room - an expensive suite - was small and in much need of a new coat of paint; the furniture was chipped. We booked a crib for our child ahead of time, but it took two hours to arrive despite numerous requests. When it arrived, it was unceremoniously dumped into the room; we had to make the bed ourselves.

We had complimentary continental breakfast due to status in the restaurant. However, since we were leaving early, the check-in W Insider took our order at the time of check-in and had the breakfast delivered to our room next morning with a personal note. The order was delivered perfectly; - At check-out, they have hotel cars that took us to the airport. They were slightly more than taxis but we traveled in luxury (Mercedes); - We had dinner at the Spice Market. Food was okay but the service again was outstanding.

101,"Travelling with a friend who arranges conferences, the W Hotel was admittedly wooing us but, none the less, I have to say, this was a fantastic place to stay with very few caveats (I'll illustrate in a moment). First, check in went relatively smooth but did take a little time (probably because it was a gift room). We were sent to our sixth floor suite which featured a very large bath with a separate tub and very nice accessories. While we did not get an ""amenity pack"" (like wine and cheese), they did provide lots of free bottles of water. The larger section of the room featured a king bed (rare in Europe) and a nice sofa. We were on a corner which was fantastic at 2pm -- not so much at 4 am. I have to say this is IN NO WAY the fault of the hotel but rather the street performers on Leicester Square.  The only other complaint (which happened in two of our rooms) was the slow-draining sink. This was oddly shaped and irritating at best to clean once done shaving. Shower was very nice with the option of a wand or the rain shower (and instant hot water, which is common there). Service was EXCELLENT -- they all tried very hard to please you and were quite attentive. Anything we needed (including a voltage adapter) was supplied with urgency. They're lobby club was VERY nice and then the Wylde night club was truly amazing (although a bit small). The DJ was simply incredibly. We stayed dancing until about 4 or 5 am. Expensive drinks, but who cares. Lots of pretty people having a wonderful time. Location was supreme -- we were just steps from the underground and they had car services available 24/7. Leicester is close to most all the theaters and night life -- especially if you are gay. Bottom line... If you are afraid of noise, stay on the back side (Above Spice Market). Much, much quieter. I would definitely stay again if I could secure a good deal.","Fabulous hotel, fabulous location - with very minor caveats",20.05.2013,4,Desktop,Denver,3,13,3,123,2007,with friends,3,5,4,4,5,5,01-05-2013,male,25-34,"Foodie, Urban Explorer, Nightlife Seeker, Beach Goer",0,Yes,N/A
102,"Stayed here with my wife at the tail end of our UK trip using my SPG points to redeem a free night. As this is a free night we were not expecting any upgrades but we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded into a Marvellous Suite! What a Wonderful surprise! Service was excellent with a great attention to detail. The only kink to this was when we arrived (driving in from the north) and the hotel was a little hard to find and the entrance on Wardour St a little inconvenient (even with the valet parking) as the hotel does not really have a driveway of sorts. This was a problem when you have many bags to unload and sort out, being at the end of a journey. Other than that service was great!  We really loved the funky decor and the huge bathroom with the free standing bath (and an accompanying TV so that you can be entertained while you soak). Like the other reviews, the downside is the noise. Even though we were on a higher floor, the sound of the club resonated throughout the night until the wee hours of the morning (being a weekend).

The hotel is so conveniently located, being right in the heart of London - ideal for us as we had shopping, dining, drinking and dancing planned for the weekend! When arriving at the hotel, the door staff insisted on carrying my bags to the check-in desk, the check-in staff couldn’t have been nicer, and when we opened the door to room 717 – the Wow Suite was truly WOW! The layout was so original with curtains separating the bedroom from the living-room, from the bathtub and dressing area… my fiancé and I spent the first part of our stay just exploring the room! Behind mirrored walls there was the toilet (including a guest toilet by the room door), a separate shower room with double rain-fall showers … the bathtub was massive, and the amenities were top-quality from the exclusive Bliss range (I work in the beauty industry so am quite particular about the products I use!). We also received a courtesy call from Jess Patman to make sure our room was ok and that if we needed anything we only had to phone (again great service!). A quick call to room service and our dinner arrived promptly and was delicious (my fussy eater of a fiancé said it was the best club sandwich he’d ever eaten!) … on our way out we stopped at the bar for a drink – delicious cocktails and they arrived quickly at a busy bar! One of the staff recognised us from checking in and came over to say hi and ask if we needed anything, we mentioned we were on our way out and a taxi was there immediately for us, great as it was raining and we were dreading having to hail down a taxi! To say I recommend this hotel wouldn’t be doing it justice – it’s rare to find a modern hotel in London, where the décor is gorgeous and unique, the food & drink is worth the money you pay, and the staff are courteous, helpful and go beyond the call-of-duty even when not asked! Maybe the W wouldn’t be suitable to those who’d prefer an older, more traditional type of hotel – but for the young and young-at-heart this modern and contemporary hotel is perfect!

104,"I have stayed at many premium hotels world wide and this was my first W hotel. My experience at this hotel led me to choosing the W hotel brand when possible for my business trips. I stayed at this hotel for approximately 3 months in 2011-12. From the day I stepped into this hotel, I was blown away by the cool factor that existed here. I have SPG platinum and I was upgraded about 80% of the time to a suite. My last month at this hotel I was always upgraded to the Spa Suite or WOW suite, but that is because I build a personal relation with the staff. The hotel has a very cool and trendy bar. The concierge will help you get into some of London's coolest bars/clubs. At some places, you just show your W hotel key and you get in. The other guest are very interesting people, they are mainly people who work for strategy consulting firms such as Mckenzie or fashion / art / music business men/woman. The rooms are very very cool, but lack windows. So you live like a vampire, but that is the life you will start having if you stay here for long enough. All in all, this hotel was incredible, the service was top notch, I was always treated like if I was a movie star when I entered the hotel. People remembered my name, knew my likes and dislikes, and ensured my experience was always top notch. I think only the W in Austin Texas challenges this W hotel. My only negative point is that you feel the pressure to always look good when inside this hotel and you cant just relax and be yourself, and if you live here for an extended period of time, sometimes you just want to relax.",Long term Review - Two thumbs up,30.04.2013,5,Desktop,"Oslo, Norway",5,39,21,878,2009,on business,5,5,5,5,5,5,01-05-2012,male,35-49,"Urban Explorer, Like a Local, History Buff, Thrill Seeker",1,Yes,Screening Suite

109,"I loved the W London for its great service, location and its very funky vibe. First off, service was excellent and very friendly and genuine. With NO exception. From doormen, to reception, to business centre, to room service, to the spa. That alone gives this hotel top marks. Location-wise, how could one complain, being right in the West End, on the doorstep of Soho, with easy access to the theatres, Leceister Square, Oxford Street and Covent Garden?  The atmosphere was ultra cool, with a room that was revolutionary in its design. In a nice way. The bathroom and WC sat off the main suite in swanky mirrorred cubicles, so unobtrusively that you didn't even know they were there. Running through the middle of the room was an island bench which housed a vanity and sink, as well as a work space, with all the necessary power points and connections. The bed was ultra-comfortable (classically W) decorated with a funky gold duvet and signature W cushions. The main downside was noise. I was on the 5th floor, and could hear club and street noise from below. That was fine and bearable. The more irritating thing is that fellow guests would be noisy in the corridor returning to their rooms late at night. The W, because it is glitzy and centrally located, seems to attract a type that lacks self-consciousness about speaking loudly in a hotel corridor, which is a shame. That's not the hotel's fault. I would still give this place 5 stars and return. It is super-cool at which to stay. And to the management team, continue to drill your people in service the way you have been. I appreciated it so much. I stay in London at least once or twice a year and will make this place my go-to hotel in London because of it.

110,"We just arrived home from an absolutely incredible stay at the W Hotel in Leicester Square. While the location was fantastic for enjoying the hustle and bustle of London and easy access to all sites via 2 tube stations located steps from the hotel, the real difference that made our stay so phenomenal was directly related to 2 factors - 1) the hotel staff and 2) the facilities (which were made even better by the staff). The staff was amazing at this hotel from the moment we walked in the door. It began with Adam the doorman, who was extremely helpful and very friendly in welcoming us to the hotel. Then we were introduced to the staff member that made our stay truly memorable - Dominic at the Welcome Desk. He saw within our reservation notes that we were there to celebrate our 15th wedding anniversary, and he made it his mission to try to secure the best room possible for our stay. Since we were checking in on New Year's Eve, we knew that a suite upgrade may be tough on that day. He was able to upgrade us from a Wonderful room to a very nice Spectacular room for the 1st night, but told us that he was going to monitor the reservations to see what he could do for our 2nd - 5th nights. True to his word, Dominic called us the following morning and had us upgraded to an absolutely brilliant suite by that afternoon. The spacious suite with the large tub in the middle of the separate bathroom, all with views looking down Wardour Street and over Leicester Square, had us feeling like royalty over the course of our stay! This truly was an amazing experience that was all made possible by Dominic's focus on providing superior customer service (he even sent up a bottle of champagne + a piece of red velvet cake with ""Happy 15th anniversary"" written on the plate). The great staff experiences continued with phenomenal customer service from Frederico (sp?) the doorman, who made it a point to remember my wife's and my name and greeted us by such each and every AM, helping us with a lot of questions we had each day. At the risk of being too lengthy in this review (too late for that I guess), I also had to highlight that the gym at this facility was state of the art. I travel a lot on business and always find it difficult in the major European cities to find a hotel with a really good gym. The W at Leicester Square definitely met this expectation.

We were back and forth quite a bit during the day but each time we entered the hotel we were immediately recognised and greeted warmly.We had drinks in the bar prior to venturing out, which was nicely busy with a good vibe going on, the staff gave us very attentive table service, so no queuing at the bar needed here.

114,"It was my first stay at any W hotel. I must admit that the hotel is an ultra modern one I dare say eccentric in style. The facade itself is a wall of glass looking material with colour changing neon lights . Corridors leading to rooms are very dimly lit almost dark. Decorations in common areas seem to come from disco dance floors. We were in a studio suite. This consisted of one small room inclusive of sitting area , hanging space in wardrobe was barley a foot long but there were many small shelves and small drawers around. The disappointing thing was that what was described as a full bathroom did not include a bath tub. Shower cubicle though was a double head spacious one. Sound proofing is excellent and staff is very nice and helpful. Breakfast is very good and the spice market restaurant had an interesting decor and serves nice dishes.

116,"Located in Leicester Square, a stone's throw from Piccadilly Circus and Leicester Square tube stations, the W hotel with it's unusual glass facade is hard to miss. However the arrangements of the suites (we stayed in two types of suites during our visit) were I thought rather bizarre - the bedroom in one of them had to be accessed through the bathing area and although the other was more conventionally designed, I must add that having a bathroom which was bigger than a bedroom (which was rather small) somehow didn't make much sense to my probably non-hip-self at all. The corridors in the hotel were designed to be very dark - black walls, ceiling, doors, carpet and spotlights... The rooms however were well appointed and certainly very comfortable and noise free despite being in the midst of the very busy square and the hotel itself was within walking distance of Chinatown, Covent Garden, Trafalger Square and many iconic London tourist destinations. The staff were extremely nice, helpful and discrete and the concierge was easily able to secure us reservations at some otherwise difficult to book restaurants. We didnt get an opportunity to use the gym (ironic since we had gone to see the Olympics) and the breakfast was pretty good and well laid out. Would I go back again, if I wasn't using SPG points?

117,"My husband and I have just returned from a nights stay at the W. Overall we had an amazing time. We were surprised to get a room upgrade to the E Wow Suite of all rooms! As the room name suggests from the moment we entered the room it was very Wow. This room was amazing but once we looked past the initial WOW we decided that had we paid £5,500 for the room we would have been slightly disappointed, yes the decor is amazing, the gadgets are very cool and the bed huge but the Jacuzzi bath tub is so big with such a small tap that after an hour of running it was only about half full so we gave up and pulled the plug out! There were a few other glitches but nothing really worth moaning about as we didn't pay the cost of the room (if we had I am sure some of these wouldn't have been there!). There were control pads for lights and music which could be played through all the areas of the room as well as controls for blinds etc. With regards to the hotel if you are a party goer you will find the location and the atmosphere brilliant, unfortunately after returning to the hotel after out evenings entertainment we decided that another Starwood hotel may have been a better choice for us. As we walked up to the hotel we noticed a queue of people waiting to enter we walked to the door and told the bouncer we were guests staying and he let us straight in so no problems there, thinking we would go to the bar to enjoy the rest of the evening with a drink we got out of the lift to be met with a club evening, a large queue at the bar and no seats at all! With no specific bar for guests we were left rather disappointed and we decided to order room service, after finding out our phone wasn't working we went to report this and place our order at reception. The staff were very helpful and the phone was fixed in a matter of minutes! Reception is situated right next to the bar so we could hardly hear the gentleman at reception and ended up shouting so that he could hear us! Once it arrived the food was lovely (although way to salty for my taste). Breakfast in the Spice Market was lovely, the staff were very friendly and helpful and I could not find fault.

121,"Our first impressions were mixed - for a start, it's above M&M World! However, it's a great location on Leicester Square, close to lots of London attractions. We were there because we were going to the theatre and preferred to stay over than get the last train home, and it was ideal for that, although very expensive. There was a queue to check in, which took a while, but friendly staff come over and chat whilst you're waiting, and offer a glass of water. There was also a long queue to check out, with only two desks open. The best part was that we were upgraded from a Cool Corner to a Fabulous Suite - wow! The room was big for London, although not very big for a £1000 a night suite: you enter through the bathroom, which had a large bathtub with separate shower and wc cubicles (both behind mirrored doors) and the wardrobe and storage space, plus a large tv with a waterproof remote! There were also loads of lovely Bliss toiletries. Beyond a sliding door was the bedroom part of the room, which had a huge, comfy bed, an expensive (£6 for a beer, £3.50 for a small packet of crisps!) mini bar of the type with sensors (why? I hate these), a small sofa and a desk/chair. It had corner views over Wardour Street. Because of the amount of furniture, and a huge structural column, there wasn't a feeling of space, but it was beautifully decorated. Evening turndown closes curtains, replaces towels and you get a big bottle of water. With reference to other reviews: we had to show our keys to get back in late at night, but it wasn't really an issue, and we were on the 4th floor, where, although there was some noise from outside, it wasn't enough to keep us awake.","Liked it, but with a couple of reservations",21.09.2012,4,Desktop,"Chessington, United Kingdom",6,623,218,342,2005,as couple,2,5,5,5,5,4,01-09-2012,female,50-64,"Foodie, Urban Explorer, Shopping Fanatic, Luxury Traveller",0,yes,wow suite
122,"This is my second review for the W Leicester Square. I first visited the hotel as a business traveller, and frankly I hated the room design with the sink/desk combined into one and in the middle of the room. I decided to give the hotel another try on a recent weekend trip to visit and party with friends in London. Things started off well when I was upgraded to an amazing spa suite. The downside is that the ""window"" looked into the gym rather than outside, but the upside is that the room was huge and included a sauna/steam room, huge pool, and a large bedroom separate from the bathroom. I was very pleased with the room in general. The hotel is a perfect base for exploring the Soho/Mayfair club scene, and we often started at the hotel before venturing out. The bar/club at the hotel are very popular with locals - in fact one night there was a line around the block to get in. This of course makes for a hectic entrance to the hotel, with ""bouncers"" and a velvet rope. This is ok most of the time, although I didn't appreciate being asked for my key on multiple returns to the hotel, and additionally, I had to go outside and meet visitors. I understand the rationale for this, but it's a shame that the hotel wasn't better designed with easy access for guests in mind. On the other hand, it was nice to be able to access the club and bar without any wait or hassle (as one would obviously expect as a guest of the hotel). I said in my last review that I would probably only try the hotel again if on a party weekend. For this purpose it served us well as it's close to great restaurants, all the tourist attractions, and provides a great base before going out. I would stay here again in a similar circumstance, despite the negatives associated with staying at such a popular venue. As far business travel, I would probably look elsewhere.

123,"As frequent traveller and SPG gold - W frequent guest : Pro : location, infrastructure (room, gym) - excellent SPA suites with private steamroom - highly recommended Neg : total lack of W standards - this hotel is noisy as hell during the weekends - we stayed in a SPA suite on top floor but were still beaten out of our bed by some overhyped party atmosphere on 1st floor.  Completely crazy, especially considering that the party potential is low - small area, limited facilities and above all frequented by rather dodgy oversized egos (which seem to be more appreciated then the hotel's guests ?) Breakfast is ok but basic for W. Security at entrance have more interest for party kids then guests. (Entrance completely misses its grandeur.. M&M's took it for some cash.. Bad decision !) Recommendations to duty managers are completely ignored - not put into practice.  There is something seriously wrong with the way this hotel is run. Starwood management needs to look into the (mis)management of this property before it is too late.

124,"Wow is pretty much the first thing you say when you walk in to any room of this hotel for the first time. The design of the place is amazing, sleek and ultra modern, however I would imagine not to everyones taste. We stayed at this hotel for two nights to go to a show and do some Christmas shopping. When I made the booking I did ask for an early check in which unfortunately wasn't available to us when we got there. A little annoying considering how much a night we were paying. Anyway we were told that someone would call us on my mobile when the room was ready but this didn't happen either. We went back to the hotel three hours later and told our room was ready so we could check in. We were in a spa suite (Room 735) which was nothing short of stunning you can tell a lot of thought has gone in to the design of absolutely everything. Unfortunately not as much thought went in to th function of things. The sink being part of the desk area is not great, as its shallow and water just ends up running all over the work surface. the view from the room was of the gym which was a little odd, and annoying because the massive window has one big curtain that is a nightmare to close. The lightswitch arrangement is also annoying as the combination of switches you needed to press seemed to change everytime you used them.  Having said that every member of staff was great from the guys on the front door to the cleaners. Nothing was too much for them, the let down was the security in the bar at night. They were abrupt, rude and shoved me out of the way twice when no one was coming which caused me to spill a drink. I dont know if they are employed by the hotel or an outside company but someone needs to speak to them about their manners.  We ate breakfast which was great and makes you wish every hotel did plated breakfasts and brought them to your table. On the Saturday night we also ate in the Spice Lounge which was busy but they squeezed us in and the food was delicious. Location couldn't be better right where you want to be and buzzing all the time. All in all a great hotel that would have got five stars but for the few niggles.

125,"First off I want to say that I am a business traveler (and can only review the hotel on its merits as a business hotel) and that I have stayed at the W for about 7-8 weeks in the past 2 months, giving me the opportunity to write a very detailed review that is not based on one-time experiences. I have also stayed in most room types at least for a week, so I hope I can provide you with some insights on which room to choose. For completeness sake, I am also a Platinum member. Setting the scene: I had a rocky start at the W. I stayed there in 2011 and my experience was not the best (see older Tripadvisor review) and I also had an issue with my room the very first day of my long-term stay. However, the staff really managed to turn it around for me and this review reflect the overall experience I had.  -- Location - 5 out of 5 -- Leicester Square. If you work in the City, it is significantly faster (20min less) to get to work compared to if you stay at a Park Lane hotel. The area is also great for midnight dinners or Friday drinks. -- Rooms - 5 out of 5 -- As I am staying at many different hotels, I believe each room should be reviewed for what it is. It is not fair to say that the standard room in one hotel is worse than the junior suite in another, you really have to compare apples to apples. I have stayed in almost every major chain hotel in London and can definitely say that the rooms at the W are the best there are in the city. They are spacious (again, compared to other rooms in London), modern and well thought-through. Once you figure out how to use the light switch, you start missing the same in other hotels. The windows are large and the blackout curtains are great. Sleeping: I work very long hours and frequently return to the hotel past midnight. The quality of sleep is probably one of the most important factors in my stay. Two things make the W fantastic - the extremely high quality bed (both mattress and linen) and the pleasant room temperature even when it is hot or cold outside (I can't sleep with the AC on). Amenities: Everything provided is top quality. The standard rooms come with minimal amenities present (no slippers, which I find quite odd) but you can (and should) ask for everything free of charge. The shampoo, face wash and body wash are the best I have ever had in a business hotel (all Bliss products) and I frequently ask for more just to take unfinished bottles home with me. The conditioner is so good in fact that my wife has started using it exclusively. The Bliss products are just vastly superior to any other hotel products (perhaps l'Occitane would come close but none of the chains in London provide it). Bathroom: Although the bathrooms differ very much by room type, I have to mention the shower at the W. As a business traveler, my routine in the morning consists of a 5min shower and a 10min breakfast. The shower (and this applies to all rooms) is simply the best I have experienced so far. The shower basically consists of a large shower closet - you have enough space to stretch your arms and hang the bathrobe in the shower closet - where you just walk in and turn it on.  TV/Internet: Very large TV with good selection of channels (did not try any pay-per-view). Internet is hassle-free and very fast (except for some rooms that are in awkward corners). Basically everything you could want or need (you can also plug-in your laptop to the TV very easily) -- Rooms Types -- Standard rooms (wonderful, spectacular, fabulous) - 5 out of 5 I never quite understood the difference between these 3 rooms and maybe it is just the floor level (if you are platinum and you have been upgraded to a fabulous room, don't expect a change compared to the room). For a standard room, they are great. Enough space, great shower, great bed (ask for king size), what more could you expect from a standard room? When you walk in the first time, you might be shocked to not find a bathroom - the sink is in the middle of the room. For couples or friends traveling together, this might be a bit weird, but for business travelers this is fantastic as you can shave while watching CNBC for example. For what it is, it's great. Cool corner rooms - 5 out of 5 Probably my favorite rooms, large floor to ceiling windows, separated bathroom and even larger shower (seems so at least), I loved it! Spa Suite - 4 out of 5 Nice for couples, this room has a built-in steam bath. Unfortunately, it does not have any natural daylight as the windows are facing the gym (you are looking down the gym from above).  Fantastic suite - 5 out of 5  Very spacious, great separated bathroom (you walk into the bathroom when you come in), great views - especially from the bathtub! It is double the price of the cool corner rooms but really nice if you are staying as a couple.  WOW suite - 5 out of 5 Truly wow, this is exactly what I would design my apartment to look like. The bathroom is bigger than my own living room and the double head showers are stunning. The oversized bathtub is truly wonderful if you are staying with your special someone. The only thing that would make it better was if the bathtub had bubbles. Simply wow!  -- Breakfast - 5 out of 5 -- I have stayed at countless hotels and the breakfast at the W is one of the best out there. Yes the buffet is only cold food but I would prefer the super high quality cold food that is provided at the Spice Market to any reheated scrambled eggs that taste like a sponge found in so many other 5* hotels. I frequently ordered the additional in-room breakfast and it is simply fantastic. I would also recommend the breakfast at the spice market if you were not staying at the hotel, that's how good it is! -- Spa/Gym - 5 out of 5 -- Spa and Gym are outstanding. The best hotel gym I have ever been.  -- Housekeeping - 5 out of 5 -- I usually don't mention housekeeping as I have very high expectations, especially since staying in Asia. However, the housekeeping at the W is well above par, especially for Europe. The standard things you expect (refilling amenities, cleanliness, etc) are faultless, but they also bring a great attitude to work. To give you an example, I came back to the hotel at 1am one day and wanted my sheets changed. I called and asked if it was possible, within 5 minutes 3 highly motivated young ladies came to my room and and changed the sheets immediately! -- Staff/Service - 4 out of 5 --When you stay at the W for the first time, you might be put off by the casual way the staff talks to you as a guest. As a long-term guest though and as someone who travels 5 days a week, it was a real pleasure to be treated this way and I started thinking of the hotel as my second home. I would even go out of my way to chat with the staff about the rooms, the olympics, etc. Whatever/Whenever is also great, from slippers to restaurant reservations, nothing is beyond them - exactly what you expect from a concierge.  The tech staff is also great, from fixing light bulbs at 1am to hooking up my laptop to the TV with 3 different cables that I did not have at 3am. The car service that the hotel provides is also great, especially Amit and Jonas, who are super friendly. Worth mentioning is especially Mareike Schubert, the welcome manager, who always tries to make me feel as welcomed as possible - and always succeeds! The only reason why I rated the service 4 and not 5 is because some front desk staff don't live up to the same high expectations that the others are setting. I once had to get my bill corrected and it took 30min without any apologies (I had to wait standing in front of the desk), another time when I needed my bill re-printed I was asked to explain everything again to Accounting instead of offering to take care of it (I actually had to insist on him taking care of it). But these are isolated instances and the rest of the staff is really great. -- Things to improve -- Finding small faults is not hard at a hotel and the W is no exception. Here are the things the hotel could improve: - Provide breakfast cards in room: there is 1 card in the room when you arrive, if you use it you have to request a new card. I am a frequent user of these cards and it is a (very small) annoyance to ask for them every day - Platinum upgrades: I have yet to find a difference in the first 3 room types and being upgrades between them does not feel like a platinum upgrade. However, the staff is usually very accommodating if you request a room type in advance - Umbrellas: It frequently rains in London and the hotel used to provide (very good) umbrellas downstairs at the entrance. Unfortunately this practice has stopped. Would be great to have that again!- Security staff/club entrance: this is probably the biggest annoyance of all and I know that some of my colleagues prefer to stay at a different hotel for this single reason. If you come back to the hotel at night, there is a bouncer in front of the hotel entrance (there is no separate entrance to the club) who invariably stops you from going in and asks if you are staying at the hotel. Sometimes a simple ""yes"" is enough and sometimes he even wants to see your room key. This is especially annoying for long time guests like me - the bouncer has not recognized me ONCE in 8 weeks. All in all, a great hotel and certainly one of the best in London. It has become my preferred choice when travelling to London for business and I would definitely recommend it further.

126,"Didn't realize I would break my jaw on check in at a 5 star hotel but - I did! Arrived at the W after a long flight from AUS at 6.30am and the first thing that happened was the front of house staff were engaging,friendly and attentitive. Christian, who handled our luggage was all over what customer service was all about and realizing we were ""stunned mullets"" after a long trip understood the right approach required to make us feel welcome and happy in our frail state. Next thing that happened was I broke my jaw!! Walking through the lobby I looked fearfully at the lounge in the foyer convinced this would be our place of limbo for several hours whilst we waited for our room. Five minutes later we were handed our room keys ! If only the floor wasn't Marble my jaw would not have exploded on impact after hearing this news! Our Wow suite was ""Wow"" and we had commanding views of Leicester square. Large lounge room with wide screen TV and a guest bathroom. Main bathroom had a shower with 2 heads ( not unlike some people I have met whilst intoxicated) and a huge bath. Heated Marble floors were a nice touch.  One thing to note about the UK if not aware ( which we were not). We mounted a search party that Scott of the Antartic would have been proud of in our quest to locate a power point in the bathroom. After an exhaustive search, in which we were forced to eat several of our pack mules after depleting our rations, we succumbed and contacted reception for guidance. Apparently UK law prohibits the deployment of power points in bathrooms?? - Perhaps safety switch technology has not reached the shores of the UK as yet ?? Spice Market is the main restaurant of the W. here you will find staff clad in outfits that would make Hari Krishna's jealous, but who also know how to deliver excellent front of house culture. The Crab Omlette with Sesame, Lime and a hint of Chilli for breaks is a must !! - As is the Lobster Pad Thai for lunch/dinner. The gym is well appointed and airy due to the high ceiling. Plenty of things on hand to make you grunt,groan and squeal like a Pig - But you will feel better afterwards and of course less guilty for your transgressions. Found the Spa to be surprisingly easy to get an appointment in and I like deep tissue massages so it was with much pleasure that I discovered that my therapist treated me like a farm animal when I asked for the ""deep stuff""! W London is situated in the heart of China town and the theatre district. It is also adjacent to Picadilly Circus. - You would have to be mortally challenged not to find something to see and do in the surrounding vicinity and you are very close to trains and buses.

127,"My husband and I stayed for five nights using our SPG points. We had a “fantastic suite” with a large bathroom, king size bed, and view into Leicester Square. I’ll keep my review to what it can control (e.g., I was woken up by revelers at 4 am one night, but there’s nothing the hotel can do about that).  Pros:  • Very comfortable bed • good TV channel selection • great Bliss bath products, great shower and tub • The tub drain assembly wasn’t working when we got into the room, so I called down and it was fixed promptly • I also used the concierge service to schedule a hair appointment and Jess scheduled me at a place nearby that was great • The continental breakfast at the Spice Market downstairs was really good (we did get it free, however, due to my husband’s SPG status) • The hotel is quiet- surprising given its location (see note at the end of my review) • Close proximity to two tube stops; walking distance to the West End, Trafalgar Square, Regent Street shopping Cons: W is known for their hip décor. I did feel that form outdid function here, however.  • The lights in the room were difficult to work- we never did really figure out how to shut off all the lights, so the purple under-vanity lights in the bathroom just stayed on all the time (shining into the bedroom).  • There was no door or divider between the bed and the main bath area (the toilet and shower did have doors). I got up early one morning and wish I could have shut a door between the bath and the bedroom so I wouldn't have disturbed my husband, who was still sleeping.  • There were too few power outlets. The only outlet in the bathroom was located inside the safe (!), which I didn’t discover until the last night we were there. There were only outlets on one side of the bed. • For ladies- they do provide a hair dryer, but it’s in the safe and you can’t remove it, so you are forced to stand about 6 feet from the mirror and dry your hair carefully so as to not yank the cord too far. How can I look hip and cool if I can’t have good hair? A note on the location: Some folks may like this, some night not, but I think it’s worth mentioning. Leicester Square is basically a mad house at all hours. I’m shocked I was only woken up one night by noise in the street.

128,"The W Hotel Leicester Square London - is always for me a coming back and the third time within the last 8 months for a stop in London. As I had tickets for the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Summer Games 2012 in London and needed a hotelroom with 14 days in advance. Special thanks to Starwood for making it possible for me again to get a hotelroom in the center of London with such a short booking in advance during the Olympics. The W-Hotel London is located on Leicester Square in the middle of the city and all the attractions of London are in walking distance. Great restaurants in the neighbourhood and also Piccadilly Circus close to you. If you are also looking for a great spot to reach all the London musicals, the W-Hotel Leicester Square is perfect for you. After a real warm welcome back I got the keys for my room and it was a wonderful SPA-Suite - approx. 55sqm (590sqf) with nearly half of the room as SPA with a real bath tube and a double person shower and steam bath. Perfect to relax after a day in the city or for wellness treatments directly on your room. The opposite side contains working desk, sitting area and a huge and the always comfortable W-bed. The big advantage on these SPA suites is that they are located to the inside of the hotel and gives you a great view to the gym and they are much quieter, especially in the huge cities like London. A few welcome amenities by the team of the W-Hotel London on the room and all the things I like means for me a perfect start on my London Olympic days... The hotel with the front-desk, living room and bar on the first floor is the typical W-style, very open mind and friendly, the concierge team on this W-Hotel Leicester Square is worldclass! Always asking you if interested in special events, tickets, etc - so whenever, wherever is really true. Rooms are really clean, great service and no housekeeping disturbing you in the morning, on the day of checkout, when you have a late-checkout you get a call from the front-desk asking in advance if you need assistance with your luggage or if you need a car for transport to airport or railway station. If you read all these experiences, I think I do not have to tell you that television and especially internet is working without any problem and the internet connection was really quick - so that gave me the chance to upload pictures and videos during my days. Breakfast for SPG-Platinum guest at the WHotel Leicester Square will be served in the ""Spice Market"" their inhouse restaurant and it was really good - a wonderful and fresh breakfast with a very considerate service. Next time I have to give lunch or dinner a try, as the location also looks very wonderful. Finally for me: Again a perfect time with real friendly and helpful people - when I come back to London (within the next weeks) I will not have to think about the hotel - I will go back to the W-Hotel Leicester Square and I can recommend this property to everyone looking for a great hotel in London.

129,"The hotel appointed an outside company to provide car service. The car company sent a car which was different from the model we requested and it could not take all our luggages. After more than 30mins of talking with the hotel conceirge, we ended up taking a taxi and the limousine carried our suitcases. We were not happy with this arrangement but that was the only solution available at that time. The hotel paid for the taxi fare and removed the cost of the transfer from our bill. A bigger car was arranged for our return trip to the airport as well. Although we received confirmation from the spa, they did not book the treatment for us. There was no availability when we got there and we did not get our treatments. We planned to have a relaxing afternoon at the Spa after a full day tour to Bath and Stonehenge the day before, so it was a big disappointment. They did offer us complimentary treatment at another time slot. Since our schedule was tight, we could not do it at another time. We stayed for 3 nights and we found out after the 2nd evening, there was no turndown service unless it was requested. We asked for it on the last evening but it was poorly done. Their housekeeping aka style staff collected the used towels but did not replace them. They folded the corners of the duvet and put the bathrobes on the bed. Other than that, nothing else had been done. What was disorganized when we left the room, was still disorganized. In addition, we did not get our wakeup call on the departure day. Fortunately, we set the alarm and we were not late for our pickup to the airport. We booked the Cool Corner Room and we were upgraded to the Spa Suite. Other reviewers mentioned that the room was funky and we totally agreed. We felt like sleeping in a big bathroom and it could take a while to get used to. We did not hate it but we cannot say we love the design. The steamroom inside the suite was nice. We really like the W concept and we love W London. The location at Leicester Square was excellent, right at the centre of everything. The hotel was stylish in and out. We were there during the weekend and there was a crowd at the entrance of the hotel evey evening. They set up velvet ropes with bouncers and it was like going to the most happening nightclub in town. The hotel was full of energy with the upbeat club music, the glittering disco balls and lot of good looking people both staff and guests. The staff we met were extremely friendly and helpful. We were being treated like their important guests. Even though we were disappointed with the poor pickup service and the missing spa treatment, we still had a fabulous time staying with the W London.

130,"My wife and I just spent a memorable long week-end at the W London Leicester Square in early October. Our stay has been nothing less than amazing, thanks to the wonderful and incredible Fantastic Suite we had been upgraded to but, first and foremost, because of the outstanding and impeccable service we received from everyone at the hotel throughout our 4-day stay. Whether it was the concierge desk, the reception people, the guys greeting us downstairs, those coming up for the room service, or the bar team serving up our drinks and bites at the W lounge, they were all smile all the time and always provided us a service that was simply second-to-none. This hotel is truly unique in London. A stone throw from Piccadilly Circus (which we were directly overlooking from our room !), it is right in Center London, with Soho, Covent Garden, Mayfair and most London landmarks within walking distance. And, if you like a contemporary and trendy vibe, the W lounge has to be the most lively and fabulous place to have a drink (make sure to try a Sir Winston...) at night or simply to relax during the day, both in the bar section with its never-ending curving sofa and in the more quiet ""library"" section with its high ceiling and fascinating plates-filled shelves... As to the room, well, I don't think I could have had better than that in London as far as I am concerned ! Located on a high floor, our room was very modern and sleek, extremely bright during the day, with a very comfy bed and a breathtaking open-air bathroom where you could have a bath while overlooking the city outside... At the concierge desk, Josh Brown and his colleagues arranged and secured several reservations at some of London's best and most trendy restaurants (such as L'Atelier, Zuma and Hakassan Mayfair), and they were always available to assist. They really mean it when they say ""whevever, whatever"" ! A perfect and most enjoyable stay !

131,This London hotspot follows the W model - tragically hip but very comfortable. Ask for a suite and enjoy the amazing bathroom. The dining options were terrific and the bar scene was appreciated - especially when we were tired after a long day out.

132,"As a Starwood gold member, the W London Leicester Square seemed a logical choice when visiting a friend living near the West End. The hotel is located ideally, within walking distance of many major attractions, theatre and shopping districts. After booking online, I was offered an upgrade via email for approximately USD$30 per night. Although a complimentary upgrade is standard (based on availability) with gold Starwood membership, I bought in. I had read online that the rooms at this property are very small, and both my husband and I would have to do some computer work in the room for a few hours daily, so I thought I would hedge my bets and lock in a slightly larger space. Checking in was easy, with attentive and helpful staff. During the process, we were offered another upgrade, but it was anything but complimentary - the lowest supplement was USD$150 for a spa suite. The desk clerk raved about the suite, but we declined, as we were only staying for three nights and had already paid for an upgrade. After seeing our room, we changed our minds. Though sunny and adequate otherwise, the room had only one chair and the single available work space was atop the long sink/countertop that dominated the room. The shower and toilet are in separate small closets hidden behind mirrored sections of the wall. To be honest, the decor is more fitting of an upscale hair salon than a living space, the walls adorned with mirrors, padded vinyl, and decorative china plates that seem to commemorate Whitney Houston's last bath. (Sorry - it's the best description I can come up with).  The upgrade - a ""Spa"" suite was comedically worse. Though almost twice as large as the ""Spectacular"" room, the extra square footage is all bathroom, which you must walk through in order to get to the sleeping area. There's a desk and single chair, but no window to the outside. Instead, the spa suite overlooks the treadmills in the hotel's gym, which may hold appeal for some, but only served to make me feel guilty for not working out during the trip. Also, there's no electrical outlet in the enormous mirrored ""spa"" section of the room, making it impossible to shave or blow dry your hair without standing in the middle of the mirrorless sleeping area. Another badly designed element is the lighting. There's no way of turning on the lights in the spa/bath/entryway without turning them on for the entire suite, so one person must fumble around in the dark if they don't want to wake the other person sleeping in the bed. We ordered room service breakfast, which was prompt and well-prepared, but there's no place for two people to sit and eat simultaneously. One person must stand in the bathroom at the long sink, or sit on the edge of the bed or a very low fainting couch. We eventually improvised, and used some portable luggage stands as TV trays, but really? Staying in the Spa suite was somewhat akin sleeping in the locker room of an elegant health club, but we did have a good laugh showing it to the friend we had come to visit. In summary, good service and staff, but pricey, uncomfortable and poorly thought-out living spaces.",Form over Function in the heart of the West End,28.05.2012,3,Desktop,"Los Angeles, California",4,13,26,165,2009,as couple,3,5,5,3,5,4,01-05-2012,female,50-64,Travel,3,No,Screening Suite
133,"First off, I just want to say that I don't have much experience with hotels in Europe. However, I have stayed at other W hotels and this was by far the the disappointing experience I've had. I stayed for about 2 weeks in a suitewith my family. 1. This hotel turns into a nightclub at night. They rope off the entrance and have what I think were bouncers at the door. I was told by a hotel manager once that any stay past 4 days is considered a ""long term"" guest so most staff will remember your name. But not this hotel. Every night, when coming in from dinner, I had to get ""checked"" at the door and have to flash my hotel room card.  2. From 7pm onwards, they have a live DJ and the music is loud. Maybe it's the design of the hotel but we heard the heavy bass from our 3rd floor room. The vibrations were strong enough to move a water in a glass....like Jurassic park. We asked to be moved but still ended up hearing the thump thump thump from the 5th floor. I've never had this issue with other W hotels I've stayed at. Perhaps it was a sign when in the amenities tray, they included 2 pairs of ear plugs. 3. As other reviewers have said, the room layout is just plain weird. A sink in the middle of the room? Who's idea was this? The giant half naked girl pasted across the bathroom wall is hard to explain to 2 little kids. Don't even get me started on the pic in the gym! And the hallways are dark. Really really dark. I almost felt like I needed a flashlight. 4. WiFi is really slow. It was faster across the street at the Pret a Manger. The rooms were the smallest W hotel rooms I've seen but again, this might be the norm for London hotels. The staff seemed nice enough but it was impossible to tell who was working there and who was just hanging out in the lobby. 5. The location is very good; within walking distance to many attractions. I wasn't expecting the hotel to be in the bar area of town. Lots of drunken swearing people after 8. There were the inevitable fights at 3am. I suppose I wouldn't have woken up if I had put on the darn ear plugs.  I would not recommend this hotel for families or anyone who has to get up early in the morning to go to work. It might be exciting for young singles or couples on holiday who plan to go out every night.

136,"I’ve been traveling to London for more than 15 years and I’ve stayed at over a dozen-hotel in London. But since the W Hotel opened just over a year ago, I’ve been a frequent guest. I’ve taken the time to get to know the staff, observed their behaviors with colleagues and friends who visit, as well as guests generally – and I must say there’s a genuine or authentic desire to delight guests. And this comes through at reception with the concierge staff (David, Nicola and Jess are outstanding!), management, those that work in the food/beverage outlets and housekeeping. Now, the rooms are small (but this isn’t uncommon on cities like London, NY, Paris, HK, etc.) but the suites and corner rooms are quite comfortable. Also, standard rooms are quite modern and unconventional in their layout in terms of the position of the toilet, shower and vanity – but unlike hotels that try to be too hip – you have privacy.

137,"Never though of Leicester square as a place to stay with the millions of tourists walking around, noise and all the rest, but I was pleasantly surprised. The W is in Soho, hence you are in the centre of theatre town, chinatown, and trendy-town. The hotel itself is what W is already well known for: trendy, modern, cool. I always have a bot of an issue with this as sometimes you feel you are an ""accessory"" to the bar and lounge clients that every night feel the place. Let's be clear W are both a hotel and a club, so if you are looking for strictly a business hotel, then forget it. Having said that, I was very impressed with the Staff a W: attentive, smiling, caring, stylish, in short, professional. They made sure I felt welcome and were extra nice to me. As a platinum SPG member this is maybe part of the reason why, but I observed they were treating everyone very nicely. The room is cool and modern with the sink in a central console, a bit of ""star-trek-set"" looking. My king-size bed was fantastic, the mattress, the linen were truly 5 stars. The separate loo and shower were very convenient and I loved the touch in the suite with a bathtub in the middle of the room. Two LCD TVs, i-phone/ipod charger, DVD, bar, safe, Bliss gel, lotion, etc. All as expected. I also got great views in a corner suite, although a bit fuzzy with the exterior glass shell that covers the hotel facade. Room service was good and a bit pricey but good quality. The room was over 340 pounds a night, but I was upgraded, so I cannot complain. The design of this hotel is very special and they have taken extra care with the lighting, from the corridors to the rooms. If you appreciate modern design you will love it here. If you are looking for a special weekend and feel like a celebrity, this is your hotel. You will certainly impress whomever you take with you.

139,"We stayed over on easter and this was our first visit to W in London. The location is just between Leicester Square and Chinatown and because it's on a quite tourist heavy area, we found out that taxis have a hard time getting to it at times. At worst we waited in traffic for 10-15 minutes just couple of blocks away from the hotel. Obviously it'd be easy to get off the cab, but we had lots of luggage with us. The overall atmosphere is very ""W"" so if you've been to other of the chains hotel, this one has all the signatures you're expecting. One thing we noticed, was the quirkiness that some other reviewers already commented on. Especially the storage/bathroom door integration seemed just irritating. We had 1 bedroom suite and really at times it just felt that things are too complicated/quirky to be actually useful. The bed and bathroom were great as the service for the most parts, but on our first night we woke up in the middle of the night to a fire alarm that told everyone to vacate the building. We did as instructed and it turned out to be a false alarm, but I think the management could have handeled the communication after the event better. Everyone was asking about it and we asked on few occasions from the front desk and the waiters but no-one seemed to know what happened. Our son (11) was really freaked out and had a hard time getting sleep the following nights. Finally we got word that it was just a false alarm. Room service was very swift and we were happy with it when we ordered. Ground floor has Jean George Wongenrichtens Spice Market restaurant, but we didn't try it this time. Been to the one in NYC and I suppose it's the same fare for most parts. The Bilss spa usually is great but the comment I got from my wife was that the staff was uninformed about their offering and the service was not on par with her other Bliss experiences. She had asked for something that was on the menu and the staff didn't know what she ment nor did they know where their menu is. To summarize, it offers a refreshing contemporary hotel option to the London hotel selection and for most parts it's a very qood value in their price range.

140,"On the positive side the W in London is in a convenient location, is brand new, has excellent beds and due to extensive sound proofing, is quiet. The people I met who work there were all very nice nice and helpful.  On the negative side, for my tastes, the studio suite I stayed in had the most idiotic design of any hotel room I have ever stayed in. A hotel room should make you feel comfortable and be easy to live in. This room made me want to run away. Here we go: 1. the entry to the suite is through the bathroom. So when room service came to deliver breakfast they ran into my wife who was coming out of the shower. How stupid is that?  2. I could not figure out how to get the lights to work. Despite spending about 15 minutes trying.  3. The room was supposed to be a suite, but it was really a strange shaped room with a sitting area. The couch in the sitting area was horribly uncomfortable and pretty much useless. Anyway, who would want to bring someone into a suite for a meeting and have them enter and exit from the bathroom. 4. I felt really stressed out staying in this hotel and would not stay there again.

141,"The hotel is conveniently located just off the square (basically in Chinatown) and is walking distance (2-3 mins) to the center of the square or to Piccadilly. If you are familiar with the LS area you know its definitely busy busy busy and at times can be worth the carnival ride on every corner and at other times, the novelty wears very thin. If you are planning on a near term upcoming stay, I would truthfully avoid the area since it is under construction due to the upgrades to a lot of the major pedestrian areas around London (Olympic prep). It is extremely muddy this time of year, which makes for a miserable morning commute. About the hotel: Pros: 1. The hotel may come across as a bit off putting when first glanced due to the very brightly lit facade, but once inside, it is a nice crisp clean atmosphere that one would be accustomed to with the W name. It can be a bit overwhelming, but it is very updated and the common areas are clean. 2. I've now stayed a couple times and have stayed in a standard room as well as a multi room suite. I will say that it is very unique no matter the room and the sink layout are actually pretty convenient. You walk into the room and are taking aback by the sink placement, but I can say that you got used to it fast and that it worked out pretty well given the shower placement.  3. The entire room decor and feel is actually pretty nice and if you have stayed in any other W in major cities such as New York (where the rooms, especially the W on Lex, are like old railroad apartments that were painted over with a trendy paintbrush), you'll think this is a welcome change. 4.The staff was pretty friendly so no major reports there. 5. The room service was okay, nothing to write home about. Again, if you want something that is very clean ,comfortable and new and is very center to a lot of activity and hustle and bustle then this really was a good fit. If you arent into the hustle and occasional carnival act of LS, then I would suggest somewhere else, (Chelsea or Belgravia is a good in between).",Very clean,30.01.2012,4,Desktop,Chicago,3,9,9,36,2010,on business,4,4,5,4,5,4,01-01-2012,male,25-34,Travel,0,No,N/A

Upon arrival we are not sure whether we arrived at the right place since the entrance to the hotel looked like an entrance to a club (complete with bouncer and people queuing). Fortunately, as we step out of the cab one of the hotel staff rushes to greet us and take our luggage. The studio suite was very cool and equipped with modern amenities. The bed was comfortable and we sleep like a baby. The shower was ok. The toilet “cubicle” was odd since the light would go off after a couple of minutes (when you’re still inside).

That will be so cool."" ""Yeah, and let's put up velvet ropes outside to make the hotel seem really exclusive."" WTF? It's typical W nonsense that seemed cool about 10 years ago, way overdesigned, all form over function. I can hear them now: ""Hey, let's install a NEW kind of lightswitch. Something NO ONE has ever seen before. And then don't explain how to use it!!! It will be AWESOME!!!"" Seriously, we were there 3 days and couldn't figure out how to turn on and off the lights. You could turn some on, some off, but not all of them off. No explanation anywhere. There was only one master panel and the whole thing is so stupid I guess someone might actually be tricked into thinking it's cool. Who knows. The 1st floor entry is a black room, sometimes you have to go past the velvet ropes and sometimes one of the pointless all-black-clad bouncers will ask you how they can help, but if you get past them, you're at the elevator that takes you to the lobby or your room. The elevator banks are all black, dimly lit, with hidden doors that you have to figure out (it's not hard, but still). We were upgraded (SPG Plat) to a -34 suite, which was huge by London standards. Lightswitches made no sense but the room was nice, well-laid out.  Bath. They put the bathmat inside the shower, which makes no sense, so if you just reach in and turn on the water, your mat gets soaked. Shower is awesome, good water pressure, great 4 oz bottles of bliss shampoo, conditioner, soapy sap, etc. Probably $30 worth of bath products, very nice.  Location. Location is awesome, between 2 tube stations, heart of everything.  Staff. All the staff was really good, helpful, friendly, etc. The bouncers were a weird touch, but whatever, that's part of the W d-bag vibe they invest so heavily in.  SPG Plat: you get upgraded but W's don't have exec lounge or free breakfast. There's Starbucks all over for breakfast though. Free Wifi for Plats and 2 mini-bottles of water. Overall, I liked the hotel for the location and staff.

144,"Stayed one night here, and was fortunate enough to be upgraded to the WOW Suite. All I can say is that the room was probably the best non-resort room I've stayed at. Room is expansive, and the hotel certainly has its unique touches. Think: lots of plates. We stayed during the Christmas holiday, so it was quiet, and probably not representative of the regular vibe there. the decor though absolutely matches what you'd expect from the W. The location is convenient as well, especially if you enjoy shopping and theater. A suggestion is that the front door staff could be friendlier. Also, skip Spice Market - it was quite a disappointment.",The epitome of the W brand,14.01.2012,4,Desktop,"Arcadia, California",6,125,96,176,2009,as couple,4,4,5,4,4,3,01-12-2011,male,25-34,"Urban Explorer, Like a Local, History Buff, Peace and Quiet Seeker",1,Yes,wow suite
145,"I'm just back from a fabulous Easter Weekend escapade at the W Leicester Square. It all started with me arriving a bit early for check-in, only to find that though my room was understandably not ready, I was upgraded to a Spa Suite. Now, a steam bath in your room might sound superfluous, but after experiencing it, I'm close to thinking this is the best idea ever! Being able to enjoy a steam bath before crashing in probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in, takes relaxation to a whole new level. On top of that, the room is huge with the bathroom (including bathtub, separate WC, and Shower/Steam room) about the same size as the bedroom. The only negative point I see is the fact that the window overlooks the gym and therefore the bedroom doesn't get as much natural light as it should, in my opinion. Apart from that, decoration is very modern and I can understand people used to traditional London 5 star hotels can be a little put off. It's just another idea of luxury.Moving on to the area, off course it's busy, and nearby Soho is not exactly the classiest part of London. However, it's just not fair to hold it against the hotel as if you're looking for classy, Mayfair and St James are literally round the corner. The other main asset of the W Leicester Square has got to be it's staff. They really make you feel like nothing is too much trouble. Also, being in my mid-twenties myself, I think it made a great difference to be able to interact with like-minded staff . This is especially true of the Concierge service (Whatever Whenever) who have been simply awesome at arranging things that usually don't happen (Holding a table for 1 at one of the city's busiest restaurant? Not possible... Well, actually, after a call from the W Concierge, they agreed to make an exception...). Now, I'm sure Concierges at other London 5 star hotels are also extraordinarily well connected and can open just about any (legal) door in the city, but asking Whatever Whenever just felt considerably less intimidating for me than when I had to ask the concierge at the Savoy to find me a nice dining venue, for example. It is actually like asking that friend of yours who happens to always know what's hot where...Last thing: the Bar. It has a terrific, lively atmosphere, attracts a young and cool crowd and I'm only talking about the Lounge. From what I've seen of it, Wyld seems to be an awesome place too, though I think you really get to enjoy it only if you go with a group of friends and throw your own party.So all in all it was a fantastic stay and I can't wait to go back!",Absolutely stunning experience!,08.04.2012,5,Desktop,"Paris, Ile-de-France, France",1,4,29,3,2012,as couple,4,4,5,5,5,5,01-04-2012,male,25-34,Travel,0,Yes,screening suite
146,"Situated right in the heart of where its all happening, I had a great stay at the W in Leicester Sq. The staff were extremely friendly, helpful (and good looking). Theres a nice buzz about the hotel as soon as you check-in. The bar is close to the reception area so the music as soon as your checking in really sets the tone of the 'feel good factor' about the hotel. The rooms are great, brand new, trendy and very comfortable bed! The TV channels are varied and not just news, like most hotels! Must say the room service was pretty fast and I would definitely recommend trying the club sandwich! Only thing I can complain about is that my friend stayed in an 'amazing suite',never seen anything like it, and Ive seen some amazing suites in my time. However, the lack of blackout blinds throughout made it very difficult to sleep at night, especially have all the lights and neons of the square, reflecting inside!

147,"We had a very busy, but short stay at the W Leicester Square for two nights in late Sept. I'm sitting in the Suitetyping this Review. We would rank it right up there with other top W Hotels around the world including W Taipei and W Hong Kong. You feel like you're in the centre of the city (literally) and from a design/luxury perspective. Reminder that Leicester Square and Picadilly Circus are noisy at the best of times and this is certainly NOT a hotel for those looking for tranqulity and quiet. Also Leicester Square is being renovated for the London 2012 Games, so lots of construction going on during the day. Also Spice Market (the restaurant on ground floor), can be very noisy if there are parties - we were here during Fashion week, so all the gliterati were out in full force. To that end, the Welcome Manager, Rupa Deora helped to make our stay fabulous. The Lounge was surprisingly intimate and both cool and friendly plus a nice place to take breakfast. The art/design and wonderful books were readily accessible. If you can afford to stay in the Centre of London, you can't do much better than this hip and young stylish hotel. Do ask for upgrade to their Suites particularly the Wow Suite which we made wonderful use of. We will definitely be staying here on our next visit to London.",Perhaps the most stylish hotel in London…in the center of it all…,20.09.2011,4,Desktop,"Vancouver, Canada",6,837,299,869,2010,as couple,4,5,5,5,5,4,01-09-2011,male,35-49,"Art and Architecture Lover, Foodie, Like a Local, History Buff",0,Yes,wow suite
148,"This review is based on a studio suite... I've stayed in a standard room in the past and had a much different experience. The studio suite is certainly larger than a standard room at the W, but isn't noticeably bigger than premium standard rooms at other Starwood properties. I had visited the hotel two weeks before while traveling to London for work, and stayed in a standard room, which has an awkward layout with the bathroom sink in the middle of the room, and separate shower and water closets. This makes it possible for one person to shower while the other uses the sink, but it's not ideal if you're using the countertop in the main living area as a workspace, since the sink did tend to splash. The studio suite is arranged like a normal hotel room, however, with the sink, water closet and shower all located in a separate bathroom. The hair dryer is hard-wired to a closet in the hall, however, which may be inconvenient. Our room was large enough to accommodate a king-size bed and a small rollaway, with a sofa in the corner and a large work desk. The TV in this room was larger as well, and there was a second television in the bathroom. The shower in our room leaked slightly, so we went through towels more quickly than we would have otherwise, but it wasn't an enormous issue. Whatever, Whenever was generally very responsive and helpful (though a few calls went unanswered), and it was nice to have the same representatives answering the phone each day -- we were on a first-name basis by the end of the week. The hotel is located just outside Piccadilly Circus, which is very convenient during the day, but can become overwhelming at night for families, considering that the area is a hotbed for London nightlife. You can use back streets to avoid most of the crowds, though the W itself is a popular nightlife destination, so you may be greeted by bouncers and a queue at the front door on popular evenings -- hotel guests can enter without waiting, of course. There are also plenty of dining options nearby, considering the hotel is just a block from Chinatown -- if you like Chinese food, you'll likely spend a lot of time here, since room service can be astronomically expensive (about $40 for a continental breakfast). London is quite pricey in general, though you can find some better deals by leaving the hotel, as expected. Ah, and there was one staff issue that had me slightly concerned. The fire alarm sounded one morning, and we exited as quickly as possible. We ran into the spa staff (from the floor above) in the stairwell (well, they ran into us, rather), and found it odd that they were far more interested in exiting the building as quickly as possible than assisting hotel guests. The two staff members went so far as to run around us in the stairwell to get outside. We ran into a manager a couple floors below, who was able to direct us, but it would have been more helpful for the spa staff to have been trained in assisting guests in emergencies as well. Overall, we had a very good experience, but be prepared to spend spend spend… London is very expensive in general, and the W is no exception.",Excellent property but avoid standard rooms,04.12.011,5,Desktop,"New York City, New York",4,31,69,302,2007,with family,4,5,5,4,5,4,01-12-2011,male,18-24,Travel,0,no,studio suite
149,"My wife and I recently visited London and Paris for our second anniversary. We stayed 5 nights at the W London in Leicester Square and had an amazing time. We travel a fair amount and really enjoy Starwood properties (W, St. Regis, Westin, Luxury Collection). I have stayed at more than 50 Starwood Hotels over the past decade and this was by far my favorite experience. Like most of the W brand, this hotel is super modern - very chic with changing lights on the outside, the Spice Market below and a swanky club as well. It is very centrally located on the edge of Chinatown - not more than a 15 minute walk to Big Ben and Parliament, Westminster Abbey, Buckingham Palace, or Covent Garden and is close to the Underground. The hotel is in pristine condition and the beds are great. Literally, the only negative thing I can say about this hotel is the crazy way you turn on/off the bedroom and bathroom lights. I can't explain it nor does it deserve any more attention - you'll just have to see for yourself.Perhaps what made this our most memorable experience yet was the truly five-star service our concierge Nicola provided us from the minute we arrived to the minute we left. I sent her an email a couple of days before our arrival informing her that it was our anniversary trip and our first time in London. When we checked in, she came out personally to greet us. While our room was not ready (we arrived around noon and the room was ready around 3) she assured us it was worth the wait as she had given us an upgrade and had planned something special for our anniversary. They stowed our luggage, gave us complimentary access to the spa facilities to freshen up following a long flight and provided us with a solid recommendation to get some street food from the Saturday vendors along the banks of the Thames. She sent me an email when our room was ready and we could barely believe our eyes when we returned. Nicola had arranged for an upgrade to a spa suite, champagne and a slice of cake for our anniversary and a complimentary 30 minute IN-ROOM couples massage for my wife and me - complete with rose petals strewn about the room. The next day, she was happy to chat with us about what to do, where to go and what to skip. My wife was leery about food in London as her first trip there was not so fruitful from the culinary perspective. Nicola assured us we would not be disappointed. She set reservations for us for three of the nights (Yauatcha and Busaba Eatthai) and gave us a recommendation for the best fish n' chips place in London (Rock N' Sole) and an amazing anniversary dinner spot called Sketch (the same folks that run Tryst in Vegas). She gave us a fool-proof itinerary for our stay, a good mix of the tourist spots, unreal shopping, some sites off the beaten path and helpful tips on getting around the City. She wasn't pushy at all, asked us what we wanted to do, was always smiling and engaging and truly went out of her way to make sure we had a memorable trip. While we have been to more traditional spots for vacation like Hawaii, the Caribbean, Italy and California, I can honestly say that Nicola is far and away the finest concierge we have ever come across in our travels. My wife and I would surely go back to the W London Leicester Square again if not for anything other than the way we were treated on our first visit.

I called the GM Kevin Rockey a few days before arrival and explained I'd like to set up something special. He put me in touch with Jessica Patman who emailed back and forth with me in the days leading up to the big night to help me plan exactly what was going to happen. Long story short, I was able to propose to my girlfriend in a beautiful spa suite with rose pedals, champagne and lit candles that were all set up before I even brought her to the room.

155,"Booked a studio suite for 3 nights. Before my arrival a W Insider contacted to me asking if I needed anything like a transfer or restaurant booking. First time this happened to me after an hotel arrival, so great service. I requested some restaurant suggestions and a quiet room (specially after reading some comments). Check-in was fast, kind and correct so nothing to complain. My Studio Suite was located on the 3rd floor which at first time make me feel a bit worried about noise but nothing to fear as it was placed just opposite in the building to the ""WYLD"" club and lounge bar. Yes, just above the lounge in the corridor the music was noticeable as I suppose it was in the rooms on that side (facing Leicester Sq. & Swiss ct.).  I found the room not specially large for being a suite (even for a little one), so common rooms may be quite tiny. Not also the largest bed I've slept though very comfy as expected. The only minus I found was the lenght of the sheets...a bit short for my taste. Decoration was ok although too minimalistic. Perhaps a couple of pictures on the walls would show a better ambience. The sofa in the corner was nice and confortable. There's also a main desk with a table beside where a ""connectivity dock""...USB port, European power plug...etc. There's a very large TV screen and a DVD player. The bathroom was completely separate and closed. Glass rain-shower was a must but watching the bathroom TV may be a bit tricky because the walls get easily covered by steam (ventilation in the bathroom should be better). No problems with light sensor. No one in this kind of room. Not liked the light diffusers on the mirror..the are spots on the surface but don't light your face...a bit more light would be better. Oh, Bliss bottles were the largest I've ever seen. Also plenty of towels and of course, bathrobes and slippers. And talking about lights...welll...understanding the lights in the room may take some minutes. There are two switches with four marked positions from 1 to 4...from full light to darkness. I've loved the blue ""night lights"" under the bed and in the bathroom (in the WC cabinet there's a black light). I've suggested this kind of lights in many hotels for avoiding you colliding with the walls if you wake up at night and don't want to switch on the lamps.  Refrigeration works very fine and in perfect quietness. About the hotel in general...the location is unbeatable if you want to stay in the middle of the crowd. Plenty of restaurants, clubs and fun. The hotel lounge is nice and offers many drinks but gets easily cramped. As other people stated on early evening a rope is placed at the entrance, so if you are a guest, don't queue, just go to the front of the line and show you room card. I found the corridors (and even the lounge) a bit too dark...try not to miss anything in the corridors... Ups, I almost forgot to comment about the WiFi. Yes, as others guest said, I found the WiFi cost excessive (15 pounds / day)...although you can get 1 hour free every 24 hours at the lounge. And another option is going to the Pub on the Leicester street (just beside the casino). There you can get free wifi through ""The Cloud"" public service. Just register and sip you beer :) A good place to stay and enjoy if this is the kind of hotel you are looking for.
